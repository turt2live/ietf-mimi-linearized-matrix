--- abstract

This document specifies Linearized Matrix (LM). LM is an extensible protocol for interoperability
between messaging providers, using Matrix's ([matrix.org](https://matrix.org)) decentralized room
model. LM simplifies the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) persistence of Matrix while maintaining
compatibility with non-linearized servers within a room. It does this by using a doubly-linked list
of events/messages per room with hub and spoke fanout.

LM's extensibility enables a wide range of transport protocol and end-to-end encryption possibilities.
This document uses Matrix's room access control semantics supported by Messaging Layer Security (MLS),
transported via HTTPS and JSON. The details of which server-to-server transport to use and what is
put over MLS are replaceable.

The threat model of LM does not place trust in a central owning server for each conversation. Instead,
it defines a hub server which handles maintaining linearized room history for other servers in the
room. This model permits transparent interconnection between LM servers and Matrix servers, in the
same room.

# Introduction {#int-intro}

Linearized Matrix derives from Matrix ([matrix.org](https://matrix.org)). Matrix is an interoperable
decentralized communications protocol with an open specification. Matrix uses a Directed Acyclic Graph
(DAG) to persist rooms, synchronizing the DAG between servers. Linearized Matrix uses an append-only
doubly-linked list. A hub server is present in each room to persist the linked list, and to handle
linearization of events (user/application messages, as well as room configuration changes) from other
servers.

The hub server in a room does not act as an owner for the room. All rooms support the doubly-linked
list and a DAG at the same time. The precise details of DAG and linked list interconnection are not
covered by this document; they are out of scope for the More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI)
working group. Full details are available within the Matrix specification process as {{MSC3995}}. Where
applicable, this document covers the mandatory components.

As rooms support these two representations, this permits a variable threat model. Messaging providers
who want to deliver all their messages/don't trust other servers to deliver their messages would choose
the DAG representation, at the cost of implementation complexity. Providers using the Linearized Matrix
representation place trust in the hub server to deliver the messages. Those providers attach verifiable
hashes and signatures to each event as a safeguard against the hub server modifying the events.

The primary exports of Linearized Matrix are the room model and the rules which govern how a room
accepts events. This document specifies a server-centric approach, where one or more servers perform
access control. With some changes, it can become client-centric too. This document also specifies a
transport for synchronizing the doubly-linked list to other servers. More efficient and scalable
transport methods should replace this example.

In a similar fashion, this document specifies how Messaging Layer Security (MLS) {{!I-D.ietf-mls-protocol}}
{{!I-D.ietf-mls-architecture}} could run over a Linearized Matrix room. User messages use MLS, while
state events (room configuration information) are plain-text in this iteration of the document. Clients
synchronize room and MLS group membership, while servers verify those memberships. This ensures that
users who are not in the room are unable to gain access to encrypted messages.

A key component for interoperability is consistent access control semantics. Where a single server
'owns' a room, it can establish arbitrary measures. For example, an owning provider might decide that
a different kind of password is required to join a room. This diminishes the user experience on providers
who do not (or can not) support those custom measures. With decentralization, all participating servers
must use the same consistent set of access controls. Linearized Matrix uses a decentralized room model
for this reason, with linear room history for ease of implementation.

Linearized Matrix also supports transferring a hub to a different server in the room. This enables
two major features: a hub server that wishes to leave the room can do so, as it is no longer responsible
for handling events for the room, and because the hub could change at any time, access control semantics
must remain consistent. As a bonus, hub transfers make it possible for a (non-linearized) Matrix server
to take hub status. When it becomes the hub, it takes responsibility for linearizing the room's DAG
for other Linearized Matrix servers in the room. The DAG linearization algorithm is not specified in
this document; it is out of scope for the MIMI working group.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document uses {{!I-D.ralston-mimi-terminology}} for the majority of terminology.

This document additionally defines:

**Rejection**: An event which is "rejected" is not relayed to any local clients and is not appended
to the room in any way.

**Soft Failure**: An event which is "soft-failed" SHOULD NOT be relayed to any local clients, nor be
used as in `auth_events` if possible. The event is otherwise appended to the room as per usual.

Further terms are introduced in-context within this document.

**TODO**: We should move/copy those definitions up here anyways.

# Architecture

~~~

In this diagram, events ({{int-pdu}}) are objects which carry information about the room as well as messages
between users within that room.

Server A is acting as a hub for the other two servers in the diagram. Servers B and C do
not converse directly when sending events to the room: those events are instead sent to the
hub which then distributes them back out to all participating servers. Servers communicate
with each other using the API surface described by {{int-transport}}.

Clients are shown in the diagram here for demonstrative purposes only. No Client-Server API
or other requirements of clients are specified in this document.

This leads to two distinct roles:

* **Hub server**: the server responsible for holding conversation history on behalf of
  other servers in the room.

* **Participant server**: any non-hub server. This server MAY persist conversation history
  or rely on the hub server instead.

**OPEN QUESTION**: Should we support having multiple hubs for increased trust between
participant and hub? (participant can pick the hub it wants to use rather than being
forced to use a single hub)

**OPEN QUESTION**: Should we instead require that each server persist events they create, with the hub
being responsible for purely distribution/fetching? It'd be in the hub's best interest to store all
history, but equally if it can rebuild the room by reaching out to origin servers then it might be
fine enough (it'd only be storing event IDs rather than whole events).

## Server Names {#int-server-names}

Each messaging provider is referred to as a "server" and has a "domain name" or "server name"
to uniquely identify it. This server name is then used to namespace user IDs, room IDs/aliases,
etc.

A server name MUST be compliant with {{Section 2.1 of RFC1123}}. Improper server names MUST be
considered "uncontactable" by a server.

A server MUST NOT use a literal IPv4 or IPv6 address as a server name. Doing so reduces the ability
for the server to move to another internet address later, and IP addresses are generally difficult
to acquire a certificate for (required in {{int-transport}}). Additionally, servers SHOULD NOT use
an explicit port in their server name for similar portability reasons.

The approximate ABNF {{!RFC5234}} grammar for a server name is:

~~~
server_name = hostname [ ":" port ]
port        = 1*5DIGIT
hostname    = 1*255dns-char
dns-char    = DIGIT / ALPHA / "-" / "."
~~~

Server names MUST be treated as case sensitive (`eXaMpLe.OrG`, `example.org`, and `EXAMPLE.ORG`
are 3 different servers). Server names SHOULD be lower case (`example.org`) and SHOULD NOT exceed
230 characters for ease of use. The 230 characters specifically gives room for a suitably long
localpart while being within the 255 allowable characters from {{Section 2.1 of RFC1123}}.

Examples:

* `example.org` (DNS host name)
* `example.org:5678` (DNS host name with explicit port)

## Rooms {#int-room-id}

Rooms hold the same definition under {{!I-D.ralston-mimi-terminology}}: a conceptual place
where users send and receive events. All users with sufficient access to the room receive
events sent to that room.

The different chat types are represented by rooms through state events ({{int-state-events}}), which
ultimately change how the different algorithms in the room version ({{int-room-versions}}) behave.

Rooms have a single internal "Room ID" to identify them from another room. The ABNF {{!RFC5234}}
grammar for a room ID is:

~~~
room_id = "!" room_id_localpart ":" server_name
room_id_localpart = 1*opaque
opaque = DIGIT / ALPHA / "-" / "." / "~" / "_"
~~~

`server_name` is inherited from {{int-server-names}}.

`room_id` MUST NOT exceed 255 characters and MUST be treated as case sensitive.

Example: `!abc:example.org`.

The `server_name` for a room ID does *NOT* indicate the room is "hosted" or served by that
domain. The domain is used as a namespace to prevent another server from maliciously taking
over a room. The server represented by that domain may no longer be participating in the room.

The entire room ID after the `!` sigil MUST be treated as opaque. No part of the room ID should
be parsed, and cannot be assumed to be human-readable.

### Room Versions {#int-room-versions}

**TODO**: We should consider naming this something else.

Each room declares which room version it's using, and each room version (identified by a single
string) describes the specific algorithms a server needs to follow in order to particpate in rooms
with that version. Room versions are immutable once specified, as otherwise a change in algorithms
could cause a split-brain between servers participating in affected rooms.

Room versions prefixed with `I.` MUST only be used within the IETF specification process.
Room versions consisting solely of `0-9` and `.` MUST only be used by the Matrix protocol.

This document as a whole describes `I.1` as a room version.

Servers MUST implement support for `I.1` at a minimum. Servers SHOULD use `I.1` when creating
new rooms.

**Implementation note**: Currently `I.1` is not a real thing. Use
`org.matrix.i-d.ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix.02` when testing against other Linearized Matrix
implementations. This string may be updated later to account for breaking changes.

**Implementation note**: `org.matrix.i-d.ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix.00` also exists in the
wild, defining a set of algorithms which exist in a prior version of this document (00 and 01).

**TODO**: Remove implementation notes.

There is no implicit ordering or hierarchy to room versions. Future room versions, such as an `I.2`,
can choose to build upon `I.1`'s algorithms or start completely from scratch if they prefer.

A room version has the following algorithms defined:

* Event authorization - Rules which govern when events are accepted, rejected, or soft-failed
  by a server. For `I.1`, this is {{int-auth-rules}}.
* Redaction - Description of which fields to keep on an event during redaction. Redaction is
  used by the signing and hash algorithms, meaning they need to be consistent across implementations.
  For `I.1`, this is {{int-redactions}}.
* Event format - Which fields are expected to be present on an event, and the schema for each. For
  `I.1`, this is {{int-pdu}}.
* Canonical JSON - Specific details about how to canonicalize an event as JSON. This is used
  by the signing algorithm and must be consistent between implementations. For `I.1`, this is
  {{int-canonical-json}}.
* Hub selection - Rules around picking the hub server and transferring to a new hub. For `I.1`,
  this is {{int-hub-selection}}.
* Identifier grammar - All identifiers (room IDs, user IDs, event IDs, etc) can change grammar
  within a room version. As such, they SHOULD generally be treated as opaque as possible over a
  transport. For `I.1`, these details are described in {{int-server-names}}, {{int-room-id}},
  {{int-user-id}}, {{int-device-id}}, and {{int-pdu}}.

The transport between servers is decoupled from the algorithms above. For example, events are
treated as blobs with no specific format over the wire but have strict schema in the context
of a room or room version. Endpoints MUST be designed with this distinction in mind.

Each room version has a "stable" or "unstable" designation. Stable room versions SHOULD be used
in production by messaging providers. Unstable room versions might contain bugs or are not yet
fully specified and SHOULD NOT be used in production by messaging providers.

`I.1` shall be considered "stable".

**Implementation note**: `org.matrix.i-d.ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix.02` is considered "unstable".

**TODO**: Remove implementation notes.

**TODO**: Matrix considers a version as stable once accepted through FCP. When would be the
process equivalent for the IETF?

The ABNF {{!RFC5234}} grammar for a room version is:

~~~
room_version = 1*128room_version_char
room_version_char = DIGIT
                  / %x61-7A         ; a-z
                  / "-" / "."
~~~

Examples:

* `1`
* `I.1`
* `org.example.my-room-version`

Room versions not formally specified SHOULD be prefixed using reverse domain name notation,
creating a sort of namespace. `org.example.my-room-version` is an example of this.

## Users {#int-user-id}

As described by {{!I-D.ralston-mimi-terminology}}, a user is typically a human which operates
a client. Each user has a distinct user ID.

The ABNF {{!RFC5234}} grammar for a user ID is:

~~~
user_id = "@" user_id_localpart ":" server_name
user_id_localpart = 1*user_id_char
user_id_char = DIGIT
             / %x61-7A                   ; a-z
             / "-" / "." / "="
             / "_" / "/" / "+"
~~~

`server_name` is inherited from {{int-server-names}}.

`user_id` MUST NOT exceed 255 characters and MUST be treated as case sensitive.

Examples:

* `@alice:example.org`
* `@watch/for/slashes:example.org`

`user_id_localpart` SHOULD be human-readable and notably MUST NOT contain uppercase letters.

`server_name` denotes the domain name ({{int-server-names}}) which allocated the ID, or would allocate
the ID if the user doesn't exist yet.

Identity systems and messaging providers SHOULD NOT use a phone number in a localpart. Using a phone
number would mean that when a human operator's changes their phone number then they'd lose access to
their existing chats and potentially gain access to any chats the new number is participating in.
Providers which use phone numbers SHOULD ensure the new user ID is not in chats belonging to a different
logical user. To prevent this case, a GUID (scoped to the allocating server) or an account ID is
recommended as a localpart, allowing users to change their phone number without losing chats.

This document does not define how a user ID is acquired. It is expected that an identity specification
under MIMI will handle resolving email addresses, phone numbers, names, and other common queries
to user IDs.

User IDs are sometimes informally referenced as "MXIDs", short for "Matrix User IDs".

## Devices {#int-device-id}

Each user can have zero or more devices/active clients. These devices are intended to be members
of the MLS group and thus have their own key package material associated with them.

Because device IDs are used as "key versions" in a key ID ({{int-signing}}), they have a compatible
ABNF {{!RFC5234}} grammar:

~~~
device_id = 1*key_version_char
device_id_char = ALPHA / DIGIT / "_"
~~~

## Events {#int-pdu}

All data exchanged over Linearized Matrix is expressed as an "event". Each client action
(such as sending a message) correlates with exactly one event. All events have a `type`
to distinguish them, and use reverse domain name notation to namespace custom events
(for example, `org.example.appname.eventname`).

Event types using `m.` as a prefix MUST only be used by the protocol.

When events are traversing a transport to another server they are referred to as a
**Persistent Data Unit** or **PDU**. Structurally, an event and PDU are the same.

An event has the following minimum fields:

* `room_id` (string; required) - The room ID for where the event is being sent. This MUST be
  a valid room ID ({{int-room-id}}).

* `type` (string; required) - A UTF-8 {{!RFC3629}} string to distinguish different data types
  being carried by events. Event types are case sensitive. This MUST NOT exceed 255 characters.

* `state_key` (string; optional) - A UTF-8 {{!RFC3629}} string to further distinguish an event
  as a state event (see {{int-state-events}}). Can be an empty string. This MUST NOT exceed 255
  characters.

  Each event type specifies its own state key requirements. For `m.room.member` ({{int-ev-member}}),
  the state key is the user ID ({{int-user-id}}) for which the membership applies to. For
  `m.room.join_rules` ({{int-ev-join-rules}}), this is an empty string. For a custom event type
  this may be an opaque string such as a UUID or randomly generated string.

* `sender` (string; required) - The user ID which is sending this event. This MUST be a valid
  user ID ({{int-user-id}}).

* `origin_server_ts` (64-bit integer; required) - The milliseconds since the unix epoch for when this
  event was created.

* `hub_server` (string; optional) - When a hub server is converting an LPDU ({{int-lpdu}}) to a
  formal event, it MUST specify its own server name ({{int-server-names}}) here. The value MUST be
  a valid server name.

  To support interconnection with non-linearized Matrix, as discussed in {{int-intro}}, events
  created outside of a hub server MUST NOT populate this field.

* `content` (object; required) - The event content. The specific schema depends on the event
  type. Clients and servers processing an event MUST NOT assume the `content` is safe or
  accurately represented. Malicious clients and servers are able to send payloads which don't
  comply with a given schema, which may cause unexpected behaviour on the receiving side.
  For example, a field marked as "required" might be missing.

* `hashes` (object; required) - The content hashes ({{int-content-hashes}}) for the event. There is
  a special `lpdu` key to contain the LPDU (partial PDU schema; see {{int-lpdu}}) hashes, which is
  itself keyed by hash algorithm and has the encoded hash as the value. The `hashes` object, outside
  of `lpdu`, similarly is keyed by hash algorithm with encoded hash values.

  Events which specify a `hub_server` MUST additionally contain an `lpdu` hash. All other events MUST
  NOT contain `lpdu` hashes. This is to support interconnection with non-linearized Matrix, as discussed
  in {{int-intro}}.

* `signatures` (object; required) - Keyed first by domain name then by key ID, the signatures for
  the event.

* `auth_events` (array of strings; required) - The event IDs which prove the sender is able to
  send this event in the room. Which specific events are put here are defined by the auth events
  selection algorithm ({{int-auth-selection}}).

* `prev_events` (array of strings; required) - This field is to support interconnection with
  non-linearized Matrix, discussed in {{int-intro}}. Events which specify a `hub_server` are expected
  to have exactly 1 entry in this array, while other events MAY have 1 or more entries.

Note that an event ID is not specified on the schema. Event IDs are calculated to ensure accuracy
and consistency between servers. To determine the ID for an event, calculate the reference hash
({{int-reference-hashes}}) then encode it using URL-safe Unpadded Base64 ({{int-unpadded-base64}})
and prefix that with the event ID sigil, `$`. For example, `$nKHVqt3iyLA_HEE8lT1yUaaVjjBRR-fAqpN4t7opadc`.

Using a reference hash in the event ID prevents other servers from changing what that event ID represents.
If an event ID was just a UUID (or similar), any server along the send or receive path could swap the
actual event payload out for a different event. The hashes and signatures in this case do nothing to
protect the actual event, as a malicious server can simply generate legal hashes/signatures as part of
their modification. If we add a namespace condition where the event ID *must* reference the same server
name as the `sender` (`$uuid:example.org`) then the sending server is free to re-assign the event ID
to a different payload during the sending of that event, though all other servers along the send/receive
path cannot change the event. This is particularly problematic if the event's sender is the hub for
the room: the hub can send one copy of an event to half the room, and a very different copy to the other
half while still maintaining the same event ID for both halves. To fix this, a hash of the event itself
would need to become part of the event ID such that any modification or reassignment of the event ID
is made obvious to receipient servers. This could be a tuple of `(uuid, hash)`, though for simplicity
this document uses just the reference hash on its own.

With event IDs containing hashes of the events it's theoretically possible for a sufficiently motivated
person to build a database of event IDs. With that database, they could eventually determine enough
information to identify parts of the event payload itself. There is not enough anchoring information
on an event (or sent over the transport) for this to be efficient or effective, however.

The ABNF {{!RFC5234}} for an event ID is:

~~~
event_id = "$" reference_hash
reference_hash = 1*urlsafe_unpadded_base64_char
urlsafe_unpadded_base64_char = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_"
~~~

If both the sender and receiver are implementing the algorithms correctly, the event ID will be
the same. When different, the receiver will have issues accepting the event (none of the `auth_events`
will make sense, for example). The sender and receiver will need to review that their implementation
matches the specification in this case.

Events are treated as JSON {{!RFC8259}} within the protocol, but can be encoded and represented by
any binary-compatible format. Additional overhead may be introduced when converting between formats,
however.

An example event is:

~~~ json
{
  "room_id": "!abc:example.org",
  "type": "m.room.member",
  "state_key": "@alice:first.example.org",
  "sender": "@bob:second.example.org",
  "origin_server_ts": 1681340188825,
  "hub_server": "first.example.org",
  "content": {
    "membership": "invite"
  },
  "hashes": {
    "lpdu": {
      "sha256": "<unpadded base64>"
    },
    "sha256": "<unpadded base64>"
  },
  "signatures": {
    "first.example.org": {
      "ed25519:1": "<unpadded base64 signature covering whole event>"
    },
    "second.example.org": {
      "ed25519:1": "<unpadded base64 signature covering LPDU>"
    }
  },
  "auth_events": ["$first", "$second"],
  "prev_events": ["$parent"]
}
~~~

An event/PDU MUST NOT exceed 65536 bytes when formatted using Canonical JSON ({{int-canonical-json}}).
Note that this includes all `signatures` on the event.

Fields have no size limit unless specified above, other than the maximum 65536 bytes for the whole
event.

### Linearized PDU {#int-lpdu}

All events generated by participant servers are routed through the hub, but the participant servers
themselves are unable to populate fields like `prev_events` because they can't guarantee order and
those fields contribute to the event ID, signatures, and overall validity. To fix this, participant
servers send the hub server a "Linearized PDU" or "LPDU" which does not include the fields they cannot
set while still ensuring integrity of the event contents themselves.

The participant server MUST NOT populate the following fields on events (LPDUs) they are sending to
the hub:

* `auth_events` - the participant cannot reliably determine what allows it to send the event.
* `prev_events` - the participant cannot reliably know what event precedes theirs.
* `hashes` (except `hashes.lpdu`) - top-level hashes cover the above two fields.

The participant server MUST populate the `hashes.lpdu` object, covering a content hash
({{int-content-hashes}}) of the partial event, giving authenticity to the sender's contents. The
participant server additionally signs this partial event before sending it to the hub.

The participant server will receive an echo of the fully-formed event from the hub once appended
to the room.

### State Events {#int-state-events}

State events track metadata for the room, such as name, topic, and members. State is keyed by a
tuple of `type` and `state_key`. The state "at" an event is the set of state events which have
the most recent (in terms of event ordering, not timestamp) state tuple.

For example, consider the following (simplified) room history:

~~~ json
[
   /* in all events, irrelevant fields are not shown for brevity */

   /* 0 */ {
      "type": "m.room.create", "state_key": ""
   },

   /* 1 */ {
      "type": "m.room.member", "state_key": "@alice:example.org"
   },

   /* 2 */ {
      "type": "m.room.encrypted"
   },

   /* 3 */ {
      "type": "m.room.member", "state_key": "@bob:example.org"
   },

   /* 4 */ {
      "type": "m.room.member", "state_key": "@alice:example.org"
   }
]
~~~

The state at index 2 consists of Alice's `m.room.member` event ({{int-ev-member}}) and the `m.room.create`
event ({{int-ev-create}}) from the room. The `m.room.encrypted` event itself is not a state event
and therefore does not get appended to the state "at" any particular event.

The state at index 4 would have Alice's new `m.room.member` event, Bob's `m.room.member` event, and the
`m.room.create` event from before. Alice's old membership event is overridden due to having the same
`type` and `state_key` as the previous event. Note however that the state at index 3 still contains
the older membership event, as the new event happens later with respect to event ordering.

"Current state" is the state at the most recent event in the room. Calculating the state at a given
event is needed for the authorization rules ({{int-auth-rules}}) and event visibility ({{int-calc-event-visibility}})
algorithms. Clients additionally need to know current state to show accurate room names, topics,
avatars, etc.

#### Stripped State {#int-stripped-state}

Stripped state events are extremely simplified state events to provide context to a user for an invite
({{int-transport-invites}}) or knock ({{int-transport-knocks}}). Servers and clients have no ability
to verify the events outside of the context for a room, so all such fields are removed. Servers and
clients MUST NOT rely on the events being accurate because they cannot independently verify them.

When generating stripped state for an invite or knock, the following events SHOULD be included
if present in the current room state itself:

* `m.room.create` ({{int-ev-create}})
* `m.room.name` (**TODO**: Link)
* `m.room.avatar` (**TODO**: Link)
* `m.room.topic` (**TODO**: Link)
* `m.room.join_rules` ({{int-ev-join-rules}})
* `m.room.canonical_alias` (**TODO**: Link)

Servers MAY include other event types/state keys. The above set gives users enough context to determine
if they'd like to knock/join the room, as features such as the name and avatar are generally key pieces
of information for a user.

Stripped state events MUST only have `sender`, `type`, `state_key`, and `content` from the event
schema ({{int-pdu}}).

Example:

~~~ json
{
   "type": "m.room.create",
   "sender": "@alice:example.org",
   "state_key": "",
   "content": {
      "room_version": "I.1"
   }
}
~~~

### Event Types

Linearized Matrix defines the following event types. The section headers are the event `type`.

#### `m.room.create` {#int-ev-create}

The very first event in the room. It MUST NOT have any `auth_events` or `prev_events`, and the
domain of the `sender` MUST be the same as the domain in the `room_id`. The `state_key` MUST
be an empty string.

The `content` for a create event MUST have at least a `room_version` field to denote what set
of algorithms the room is using.

These conditions are checked as part of the event authorization rules ({{int-auth-rules}}).

#### `m.room.join_rules` {#int-ev-join-rules}

Defines whether users can join without an invite and other similar conditions. The `state_key`
MUST be an empty string. Any other state key, including lack thereof, serve no meaning and
are treated as though they were a custom event.

The `content` for a join rules event MUST have at least a `join_rule` field to denote the
join policy for the room. Allowable values are:

* `public` - anyone can join without an invite.
* `knock` - users must receive an invite to join, and can request an invite (knock) too.
* `invite` - users must receive an invite to join.

**TODO**: Describe `restricted` (and `knock_restricted`) rooms?

**TODO**: What's the default?

#### `m.room.member` {#int-ev-member}

Defines the membership for a user in the room. If the user does not have a membership event then
they are presumed to be in the `leave` state.

The `state_key` MUST be a non-empty string denotating the user ID the membership is affecting.

The `content` for a membership event MUST have at least a `membership` field to denote the
membership state for the user. Allowable values are:

* `leave` - not participating in the room. If the `state_key` and `sender` do not match, this was
  a kick rather than voluntary leave.
* `join` - participating in the room.
* `knock` - requesting an invite to the room.
* `invite` - invited to participate in the room.
* `ban` - implies kicked/not participating. Cannot be invited or join the room without being
  unbanned first (moderator sends a kick, essentially).

These conditions are checked as part of the event authorization rules ({{int-auth-rules}}),
as are the rules for moving between membership states.

The `content` for a membership event MAY additionally have a `reason` field containing a human-readable
(and usually human-supplied) description for why the membership change happened. For example, the reason
why a user was kicked/banned or why they are requesting an invite by knocking.

#### `m.room.power_levels` {#int-ev-power-levels}

Defines what given users can and can't do, as well as which event types they are able to send.
The enforcement of these power levels is determined by the event authorization rules ({{int-auth-rules}}).

The `state_key` MUST be an empty string.

The `content` for a power levels event SHOULD have at least the following:

* `ban` (integer) - the level required to ban a user. Defaults to `50` if unspecified.
* `kick` (integer) - the level required to kick a user. Defaults to `50` if unspecified.
* `invite` (integer) - the level required to invite a user. Defaults to `0` if unspecified.
* `redact` (integer) - the level required to redact an event sent by another user. Defaults
  to `50` if unspecified.
* `events` (map) - keyed by event type string, the level required to send that event type to
  the room. Defaults to an empty map if unspecified.
* `events_default` (integer) - the level required to send events in the room. Overridden by
  the `events` map. Defaults to `0` if unspecified.
* `state_default` (integer) - the level required to send state events in the room. Overridden
  by the `events` map. Defaults to `50` if unspecified.
* `users` (map) - keyed by user ID, the level of that user. Defaults to an empty map if
  unspecified.
* `users_default` (integer) - the level for users. Overridden by the `users` map. Defaults to
  `0` if unspecified.

**TODO**: Include notifications for at-room here too?

Note that if no power levels event is specified in the room then the room creator (`sender` of
the `m.room.create` state event) has a default power level of 100.

These conditions are checked as part of the event authorization rules ({{int-auth-rules}}).

#### `m.room.history_visibility`

**TODO**: Describe.

##### Calculating Event Visibility {#int-calc-event-visibility}

**TODO**: Describe. (when can a server see an event?). Mention that `m.mls.commit` is exempt.

**TODO**: This section feels like it's in the wrong place. Bring it closer to on-receive-event sections.

#### TODO: Other events

**TODO**: `m.room.name`, `m.room.topic`, `m.room.avatar`, `m.room.canonical_alias`

# MLS Considerations {#int-mls-considerations}

**TODO**: We should consider running {{?I-D.robert-mimi-delivery-service}} over LM instead.
Using something like {{?I-D.mahy-mimi-group-chat}} would be good for more of a client-side
representation of the LM room model.

The MIMI working group is chartered to use Messaging Layer Security (MLS) {{!I-D.ietf-mls-protocol}}
{{!I-D.ietf-mls-architecture}} for encryption in chats, and this document specifies no different.
Each room has a single MLS Group associated with it, both identified by the room ID ({{int-room-id}}).

Rooms additionally track membership at a per-user level while MLS tracks group membership at a
per-device level. With this consideration, commits to the MLS Group MUST use `PublicMessage`, giving
the hub server an ability to inspect MLS group membership changes for illegal joins and leaves.

Encryption can only be enabled at the time the room is created. This prevents the room having encryption
disabled or downgraded without an entirely new room being created. The exact ciphersuite and other
algorithmic details are contained in the `content` for the `m.room.create` event ({{int-ev-create}}):

~~~ json
{
   "encryption": {
      "algorithm": "m.mls.v1.dhkemx25519-aes128gcm-sha256-ed25519"
   }
}
~~~

`algorithm` denotes which specific algorithm clients MUST use for sending and receiving encrypted
events in the room. If a received event is encrypted using a different algorithm, it MUST be treated
as undecryptable (even if the client has sufficient key information to decrypt it).

`m.mls.v1.` as a prefix describes the behaviour for encrypted clients, with the remainder of the
algorithm string covering the exact ciphersuite. This document uses the same mandatory ciphersuite
as MLS: `MLS_128_DHKEMX25519_AES128GCM_SHA256_Ed25519`. Thus, this is encoded as
`m.mls.v1.dhkemx25519-aes128gcm-sha256-ed25519`. Other ciphersuites can be represented similarly,
though are considered to be entirely new encryption algorithms for the purposes of this document.

Custom or non-standard encryption algorithms are possible with this approach, however out of scope
for MIMI. If such an algorithm is used, it SHOULD be prefixed using reverse domain name notation.
For example, `org.example.my-encryption`.

Mentioned in the introduction ({{int-intro}}), this document does not explore the details for what is
needed to interconnect Linearized Matrix and Matrix's existing room model. However, for interconnection
to be successful, extensions to MLS are needed to support decentralization. One possible extension
is "Decentralised MLS" {{DMLS}}.

## Device Credentials {#int-mls-credentials}

Under Section 5.3 of {{!I-D.ietf-mls-protocol}}, each MLS group member (a device, {{int-device-id}})
has a "credential" or signing key associated with it. These are published to each client's local server
and available over federation ({{int-transport-mls}}).

This document relies upon out-of-band verification and therefore uses basic credentials. The format
for the credential is:

~~~
struct {
    opaque user_id<V>;
    opaque device_id<V>;
    opaque signature_key<V>;
} BasicCredential;
~~~

`user_id` is as described by {{int-user-id}}, and `device_id` is as described by {{int-device-id}}.
`signature_key` is from MLS.

The device then constructs the following object, signs it using each of the listed `keys`, and publishes
it through its local server ({{int-transport-devices}}):

~~~ json
{
   "device_id": "ABCDEF",
   "user_id": "@alice:example.org",
   "algorithms": [
      "m.mls.v1.dhkemx25519-aes128gcm-sha256-ed25519"
   ],
   "keys": {
      "m.mls.v1.credential.ed25519:ABCDEF":
         "<unpadded base64 BasicCredential>"
   },
   "signatures": {
      "@alice:example.org": {
         "m.mls.v1.credential.ed25519:ABCDEF":
            "<unpadded base64 signature>"
      }
   }
}
~~~

`device_id` is the client's device ID ({{int-device-id}}). `user_id` is the user ID ({{int-user-id}})
to which the device ID belongs. `algorithms` are the encryption algorithms the device supports, and
SHOULD contain at least `m.mls.v1.dhkemx25519-aes128gcm-sha256-ed25519`.

When a device supports `m.mls.v1.dhkemx25519-aes128gcm-sha256-ed25519`, it MUST specify its basic
credential with the `m.mls.v1.credential.ed25519` key algorithm.

`keys` is an object containing each algorithm-specific key (or keys) for the device. The fields for
the object form a key ID, with the device ID representing the "key version", as per {{int-signing}}.

All top-level fields in the object above MUST be supplied.

For each of the device's `keys`, a valid signature MUST be produced. If there is a missing signature
from any of the keys, or from the `user_id`, the device information is considered invalid. Invalid
devices MUST NOT be members of the MLS group, and are removed if already members prior to the device
information becoming invalid.

## Group Creation

After the `m.room.create` event and other initial state events for the room are sent, the room creator
MUST establish the appropriate MLS group. This is sent as an `m.mls.commit` event ({{int-ev-mls-commit}}).
Afterwards, the remaining devices are added as normal ({{int-mls-add-remove}}).

Ideally, the `m.room.create` event would also contain the initial public group state, however doing
so would mean either tracking an independent MLS group ID or allowing the client to specify the room
ID. While servers MAY allow the client to specify the room ID, servers usually have better context
for which localparts (see {{int-room-id}}) are already claimed by other rooms. Having independent
group IDs and room IDs can lead to confusion and a similar sort of namespacing issue (a room creator
can create a conflicting group ID). Instead, the server (usually) creates the room on behalf of the
client, allowing the client to then send the initial public group state to the room for other MLS
members.

## Updating Group State {#int-mls-add-remove}

This document does not provide a way to send proposals to the MLS group, meaning all commits MUST only
contain proposals which are sent by the same member (see {{Section 12 of I-D.ietf-mls-protocol}}).

All commits are encoded as `m.mls.commit` events ({{int-ev-mls-commit}}) and are sent to the room.
These commits are additionally encoded using `PublicMessage`, giving servers visibility on the contents
of the commits. Upon receiving the event (see {{int-receiving-events}}), the hub server MUST additionally
validate that any membership changes match what is possible with the room membership:

* Devices can only be added to the group if they belong to a user which is joined to the room, or if the
  room is "world readable" ({{int-calc-event-visibility}}). It is generally not enough to be invited,
  knocking, etc on the room - the user ID must usually be in the `join` state.
* Devices can be removed in two ways:
   * A device can remove another device if they both belong to the same user ID.
   * A device can be removed by anyone if the user ID to which it belongs is no longer in the `join` state.
     This condition is required to satisfy a case in MLS where a device cannot self-remove itself from
     the group.

If this validation fails, the hub server MUST reject the request if it's shaped as an LPDU ({{int-lpdu}})
and soft-fail the event if it's a PDU ({{int-pdu}}).

Welcome messages are sent to devices over to-device messaging ({{int-transport-to-device}}). The `message_type`
for the message is `m.room.encrypted` [**TODO**: Rename to avoid confusion with room event?] and `message`
of:

~~~ json
{
   "algorithm": "m.mls.v1.welcome.[ciphersuite]",
   "ciphertext": "<unpadded base64 encoded welcome message>",
   "commit_event_id": "<event ID of the m.mls.commit event>"
}
~~~

`algorithm` is the ciphersuite, `dhkemx25519-aes128gcm-sha256-ed25519`, prefixed with `m.mls.v1.welcome`.

The remaining fields are as described in the example. See {{int-unpadded-base64}} for "unpadded base64".

All fields MUST be supplied. Note that the sender's user ID and device ID are made available over the
to-device messaging endpoints ({{int-transport-to-device}}).

In all cases, a device remembers the event ID (either from the `m.mls.commit` event or `commit_event_id`
from a to-device message) after decryption to associate it with the MLS epoch. The device can then do
a reverse lookup of epoch to event ID to MLS group state. Note that a client *always* has access to
`m.mls.commit` events, even when hidden by history visibility ({{int-calc-event-visibility}}).

**TODO**: Is it correct to say all commits are visible as "shared"?

**TODO**: We may need to store the group state in the media repo if it gets to be too big, or otherwise
allow oversized events.

**TODO**: The server also likely needs to prevent devices being added to the group which don't support
the ciphersuite/algorithm.

## Key Packages {#int-mls-key-packages}

Clients "claim" another device's key package through their server ({{int-transport-key-claim}}). Clients
will typically generate several key packages and upload them to their server, making them available even
if the client goes offline.

The algorithm for a key package is `m.mls.v1.key_package.dhkemx25519-aes128gcm-sha256-ed25519` and is
combined with a device-generated key version, forming a key ID described by {{int-signing}}. The key
version SHOULD be generated based upon the key package itself rather than using an unrelated string,
such as a hash or the public key of the key package.

## Room Event Types

**TODO**: Should these be defined with the other event types rather than here?

This document describes the following event types for use with MLS-encrypted rooms. The section headers
are the event `type`. See {{int-pdu}} for more information on events.

These event types are non-state events, also called "room events".

### `m.mls.commit` {#int-ev-mls-commit}

Represents an MLS commit, which may be rejected by the hub server.

`content` for the event MUST contain at least the following example:

~~~ json
{
   "message": "<unpadded base64 encoded PublicMessage>",
   "public_group_state": "<unpadded base64 encoded public group state>"
}
~~~

As mentioned, `message` is a `PublicMessage` from MLS. `public_group_state` is to enable external
joins.

An optional field, `prev_commit_event_id`, SHOULD be specified when a parent commit exists. This is
to enable clients to find the commit they have keys for upon joining the room, as the most recent one
may not be decryptable to them. The client can then work forwards from where they can decrypt the
message.

**TODO**: Should we use the `RatchetTree` extension? It might make the group state massive...

**TODO**: Which fields from this need to be protected by {{int-redactions}}?

### `m.room.encrypted` {#int-ev-encrypted}

Represents an encrypted MLS application message. The sender first encrypts the message per the content
format then MUST send an event with `content` matching:

~~~ json
{
   "algorithm": "m.mls.v1.[ciphersuite]",
   "ciphertext": "<unpadded base64 encoded MLS ciphertext>",
   "commit_event_id": "<event ID of applicable m.mls.commit event>"
}
~~~

Within this document, `algorithm` will be `m.mls.v1.dhkemx25519-aes128gcm-sha256-ed25519`. The other
fields are as described in the example.

Clients SHOULD treat `m.room.encrypted` events which are improperly structured as undecryptable events.

**TODO**: Which fields from this need to be protected by {{int-redactions}}?

# Processing Events

An event has several authenticity properties:

* Content hashes ({{int-content-hashes}}) to cover the LPDU ({{int-lpdu}}) and event ({{int-pdu}})
  contents.
* Reference hashes ({{int-reference-hashes}}) which double as the event ID, covering the
  redacted event.
* Signatures from the direct senders (server name of the `sender` and the `hub_server` if
  present), ensuring the entities did actually produce that event.

**TODO**: Does the hub's signature actually guard anything?

These properties are validated throughout this document. Each property has different behaviour
when violated. For example, a difference in content hash ultimately causes the event to be
stored as a redacted copy.

## Receiving Events/PDUs {#int-receiving-events}

**TODO**: This section conflates sending and receiving a bit more than it should. Split sending
out to its own section.

When a hub receives an LPDU from a participant it MUST add the missing fields to create a fully
formed PDU then MUST send that PDU back out to all participants, including the original sender.

A server is considered to have "received" an event when it does not recognize the event ID. This
may be because the event has not yet been persisted, or the server is not persisting anything (in
the case of a participant server). This includes when the server asks another server for an event
it might be missing.

When a server (hub or participant) receives an event, it MUST:

1. Verify the event matches the schema for the room version ({{int-pdu}}), without considering
   type-specific schemas applied to `content`. If an event fails to meet this requirement, it is
   dropped/ignored.

2. Ensure the required signatures are present and that they are valid ({{int-checking-signatures}}).
   If the event has a `hub_server` field, the event MUST be signed by that server. The event
   MUST also be signed by the server implied by the `sender`, noting that this will be an LPDU
   if `hub_server` is present. All other signatures MUST NOT be considered for signature
   validation, regardless of their individual validity. If the event fails to meet this
   requirement, it is dropped/ignored.

3. Ensure the event has a valid content hashes ({{int-content-hashes}}). If the event has a
   `hub_server` field, it MUST have a content hash which covers the LPDU. If either the LPDU
   or PDU content hash doesn't match what the receiving server calculations, the event is
   redacted before further processing. The server will ultimately persist the redacted copy.

Additionally, a hub server MUST complete the following checks. Participant servers SHOULD
also perform the following checks to validate that the hub server is acting in a compliant
manner. If the hub is not acting appropriately (for example, by sending the participant an
event which never should have been accepted), the participant server MAY choose to warn its
local users that the room history may have been tampered with.

1. The constraints described by {{int-mls-add-remove}} validated, if the room is encrypted.

## Authorization Rules {#int-auth-rules}

These are the rules which govern whether an event is accepted into the room, depending on
the state events surrounding that event. A given event is checked against multiple different
sets of state.

### Auth Events Selection {#int-auth-selection}

The `auth_events` on an event MUST consist of the following state events, with the exception
of an `m.room.create` event which has no `auth_events`.

1. The `m.room.create` state event.
2. The current `m.room.power_levels` state event, if any.
3. The sender's current `m.room.member` state event, if any.
4. If the `type` is `m.room.member`:
   1. The target's (`state_key`) current `m.room.member` state event, if any.
   2. If `content.membership` is `join` or `invite`, the current `m.room.join_rules` state
      event, if any.

**TODO**: Talk about restricted room joins here?

### Calculating Power Levels {#int-calc-power-levels}

A requirement of the authorization rules is being able to determine the current/future "power level"
for a user. All power levels are calculated with reference to the `content` of an `m.room.power_levels`
state event ({{int-ev-power-levels}}).

To calculate a user's current power level:

1. If `users` is present, use the power level for the user ID, if present.
2. If `users` is not present, or the user ID is not present in `users`, use `users_default`.
3. If `users_default` is not present, use `0`.

To calculate the required power level to do an action:

1. If the action (`kick`, `ban`, `invite`, or `redact`) is present, use that power level.
2. If not present, use the default for the action (`50` for `kick`, `ban`, and `redact`, `0`
   for `invite`).

To calculate the required power level to send an event:

1. If `events` is present, use the power level for the event `type`, if present.
2. If `events` is not present, or the event `type` is not present in `events`:
   1. If `state_key` is present (including empty), use `state_default`.
      1. If `state_default` is not specified, use `50`.
   2. If `state_key` is not present, use `events_default`.
      1. If `events_default` is not specified, use `0`.

### Auth Rules Algorithm

With consideration for default/calculated power levels ({{int-calc-power-levels}}), each event MUST
pass the following rules. "Current state" (and "current membership", etc) are the state of the room
*before* the event being checked is applied.

**TODO**: should we reference `m.federate`?

1. Events must be signed ({{int-checking-signatures}}) by the server denoted by the `sender`
   field. Note that this may be an LPDU if the `hub_server` is specified and not the same server.
   If the event is improperly signed, reject the event.

2. If `hub_server` is present on the event, the event must be signed ({{int-checking-signatures}})
   by that server. If it is improperly signed, reject the event.

3. If the event's `type` is `m.room.create`:

   1. If it has any `prev_events`, reject the event.
   2. If the domain of the `room_id` is not the same domain as the `sender`, reject the event.
   3. If `content.room_version` is not `I.1`, reject the event.
   4. Otherwise, allow the event.

4. Considering the event's `auth_events`:

   **TODO**: Does this check make sense for Linearized Matrix? We already removed what was #3 because
   it talked about rejecting events which reference rejected events.

   1. If there are duplicate entries for a given `type` and `state_key` pair, reject the event.
   2. If there are entries whose `type` and `state_key` do not match those specified by the
      auth events selection algorithm ({{int-auth-selection}}), reject the event.
   3. If there is no `m.room.create` event among the entries, reject.

5. If the event's `type` is `m.room.member`:

   1. If there is no `state_key` property, or no `membership` in `content`, reject the event.

   2. If the event `content`'s `membership` field is `join`:

      1. If the previous event is an `m.room.create` event and the `state_key` is the
         creator, allow the event.
      2. If `sender` does not match `state_key`, reject the event.
      3. If the `sender` is banned, reject the event.
      4. If the `join_rule` for `m.room.join_rules` is `invite` or `knock`, then allow the event if
         the current membership state is `invite` or `join`.
      5. If the `join_rule` for `m.room.join_rules` is `public`, allow the event.
      6. Otherwise, reject the event.

   3. If the event `content`'s `membership` field is `invite`:

      1. If the `sender`'s current membership state is not `join`, reject the event.
      2. If the target user's (`state_key`) membership is `join` or `ban`, reject the event.
      3. If the `sender`'s power level is greater than or equal to the power level needed
         to send invites, allow the event.
      4. Otherwise, reject the event.

   4. If the event `content`'s `membership` field is `leave`:

      1. If the `sender` matches the `state_key`, allow the event if and only if that user's current
         membership state is `knock`, `join`, or `invite`.
      2. If the `sender`'s current membership state is not `join`, reject the event.
      3. If the target user's (`state_key`) current membership state is `ban`, and the
         `sender`'s power level is less than the power level needed to ban other users, reject the event.
      4. If the `sender`'s power level is greater than or equal to the power level needed to
         kick users, and the target user's (`state_key`) power level is less than the `sender`'s,
         allow the event.
      5. Otherwise, reject the event.

   5. If the event `content`'s `membership` field is `ban`:

      1. If the `sender`'s current membership state is not `join`, reject the event.
      2. If the `sender`'s power level is greater than or equal to the power level needed
         to ban users, and the target user's (`state_key`) power level is less than the
         `sender`'s power level, allow the event.
      3. Otherwise, reject the event.

   6. If the event `content`'s `membership` field is `knock`:

      1. If the `join_rule` for `m.room.join_rules` is anything other than `knock`, reject the event.
      2. If the `sender` does not match the `state_key`, reject the event.
      3. If the `sender`'s current membership state is not `ban` or `join`, allow the event.
      4. Otherwise, reject the event.

   7. Otherwise, the `membership` is unknown. reject the event.

6. If the `sender`'s current membership state is not `join`, reject the event.

7. If the event `type`'s required power level to send it is greater than the `sender`'s power level,
   reject the event.

8. If the event has a `state_key` which starts with an `@` and does not match the `sender`,
   reject the event.

   **TODO**: Do we care? This is theoretically to allow for owned state events, but in practice nothing
   which uses this concept makes it this far into the auth rules (membership events are validated above).

9. If the event's `type` is `m.room.power_levels`:

   1. If any of the fields `users_default`, `events_default`, `state_default`, `ban`, `redact`,
      `kick`, or `invite` in `content` are present and not an integer, reject the event.

   2. If `events` in `content` is present and not an object with values that are integers,
      reject the event.

   3. If the `users` in `content` is present and not an object with valid user IDs as keys and
      integers as values, reject the event.

   4. If there is no previous `m.room.power_levels` event in the room, allow the event.

   5. For the fields `users_default`, `events_default`, `state_default`, `ban`, `redact`, `kick`,
      and `invite`, check if they were added, changed, or removed. For each found alteration:

      1. If the current value is higher than the `sender`'s current power level, reject the event.
      2. If the new value is higher than the `sender`'s current power level, reject the event.

   6. For each entry being changed in or removed from `events`:

      1. If the current value is higher than the `sender`'s current power level, reject the event.

   7. For each entry being added to or changed in `events`:

      1. If the new value is greater than the `sender`'s current power level, reject the event.

   8. For each entry being changed in or removed from `users`, other than the `sender`'s own
      entry:

      1. If the current value is higher than the `sender`'s current power level, reject the event.

   9. For each entry being added to or changed in `users`:

      1. If the new value is greater than the `sender`'s current power level, reject the event.

   10. Otherwise, allow the event.

10. Otherwise, allow the event.

There are some consequences to these rules:

* Unless you are already a member of the room, the only permitted operations (aside from
  the initial create/join) are being able to join public rooms, accept invites to rooms,
  and reject invites to rooms.

* To unban another user, the sender must have a power level greater than or equal to both
  the kick and ban power levels, *and* greater than the target user's power level.

**TODO**: If we want to enforce a single hub in a room, we'd do so here with auth rules.

# Signing {#int-signing}

All servers, including hubs and participants, publish an ed25519 {{!RFC8032}} signing key
to be used by other servers when verifying signatures. These keys can then be fetched over
the transport as needed ({{int-transport-get-server-keys}}).

**TODO**: Verify RFC reference. We might be using a slightly different ed25519 key today?
See https://hdevalence.ca/blog/2020-10-04-its-25519am

Each key ID consists of an algorithm name and version. Signing keys MUST use an algorithm
of `ed25519` (and therefore MUST be an ed25519 key). The key version MUST be valid under
the following ABNF {{!RFC5234}}:

~~~
key_version = 1*key_version_char
key_version_char = ALPHA / DIGIT / "_"
~~~

An algorithm and version combined is a "key ID", deliminated by `:` as per the following
ABNF {{!RFC5234}}:

~~~
key_id = key_algorithm ":" key_version
key_algorithm = "ed25519"
~~~

Additional key algorithms may be supported by future documents.

## Signing Events {#int-signing-events}

To sign an event:

1. Redact it ({{int-redactions}}).
2. Sign the result as an arbitrary object ({{int-signing-objects}}).

## Signing Arbitrary Objects {#int-signing-objects}

To sign an object:

1. Remove `signatures` if present.
2. Encode the result with Canonical JSON ({{int-canonical-json}}).
3. Using the relevant ed25519 signing key (usually the server's), sign the object.
4. Encode that signature under `signatures` using unpadded base64 ({{int-unpadded-base64}}).

Note that `signatures` is an object with keys being the entity which did the signing and value
being the key ID to encoded signature pair. See {{int-pdu}} for details on the `signatures`
structure for events specifically.

## Checking Signatures {#int-checking-signatures}

If the `signatures` field is missing, doesn't contain the entity that is expected to have done
the signing (usually a server name), doesn't have a known key ID, or is otherwise structurally invalid
then the signature check fails.

If decoding the base64 fails, the check fails.

If the object is an event, redact ({{int-redactions}}) it before continuing.

If removing the `signatures` property, canonicalizing the JSON ({{int-canonical-json}}),
and verifying the signature fails, the check fails. Note that to verify the signature the server
may need to fetch another server's key first ({{int-transport-get-server-keys}}).

Otherwise, the check passes.

**TODO**: Which specific signatures are required? If a server has multiple signing keys, possibly
a combination of new and old, do we require all or some of them to sign?

# Canonical JSON {#int-canonical-json}

When signing a JSON object, such as an event, it is important that the bytes be ordered in
the same way for everyone. Otherwise, the signatures will never match.

To canonicalize a JSON object, use {{!RFC8785}}.

**TODO**: Matrix currently doesn't use RFC8785, but it should (or similar).

# Event Redactions {#int-redactions}

All fields at the top level except the following are stripped from the event:

* `type`
* `room_id`
* `sender`
* `state_key`
* `content`
* `origin_server_ts`
* `hashes`
* `signatures`
* `prev_events`
* `auth_events`
* `hub_server`

Additionally, some event types retain specific fields under the event's `content`. All other
fields are stripped.

* `m.room.create` retains all fields in `content`.
* `m.room.member` retains `membership`.
* `m.room.join_rules` retains `join_rule`.
* `m.room.power_levels` retains `ban`, `events`, `events_default`, `kick`, `redact`, `state_default`,
  `users`, `users_default`, and `invite`.
* `m.room.history_visibility` retains `history_visibility`.

# Hashes

An event is covered by two hashes: a content hash and a reference hash. The content hash covers the
unredacted event to ensure it was not modified in transit. The reference hash covers the essential
fields of the event, including content hashes, and serves as the event's ID.

## Content Hash Calculation {#int-content-hashes}

**TODO**: Describe what this protects, and why it matters.

1. Remove any existing `signatures` field.
   1. If calculating an LPDU's ({{int-lpdu}}) content hash, remove any existing `hashes` field as well.
   2. If *not* calculating an LPDU's content hash, remove any existing fields under `hashes` except
      for `lpdu`.
2. Encode the object using canonical JSON.
3. Hash the resulting bytes with SHA-256 {{!RFC6234}}.
4. Encode the hash using unpadded base64 ({{int-unpadded-base64}}).

## Reference Hash Calculation {#int-reference-hashes}

**TODO**: Describe what this protects, and why it matters.

1. Redact the event.
2. Remove `signatures` field.
3. Encode the object using canonical JSON.
4. Hash the resulting bytes with SHA-256 {{!RFC6234}}.
5. Encode the hash using URL-safe unpadded base64 ({{int-unpadded-base64}}).

# Unpadded Base64 {#int-unpadded-base64}

Throughout this document, "unpadded base64" is used to represent binary values as strings. Base64 is
as specified by {{Section 4 of RFC4648}}, and "unpadded base64" simply removes any `=` padding from
the resulting string.

Implementations SHOULD accept input with or without padding on base64 values, where possible.

{{Section 5 of RFC4648}} describes *URL-safe* base64. The same changes are adopted here. Namely, the
62nd and 63rd characters are replaced with `-` and `_` respectively. The unpadded behaviour is as
described above.

# Hub Selection {#int-hub-selection}

**TODO**: Describe impacts of hub transfers

The hub server for a room is the server denoted by the `sender` of the `m.room.create` event
({{int-ev-create}}). Note that this is effectively the same as the server name contained in the
room ID ({{int-room-id}}) currently, however is deliberately not defined as such. In a future
scenario where hub transfers are possible, the room ID does not change when the hub server does.

## Hub Transfers

**TODO**: This section, if we want a single canonical hub in the room. Some expected problems in this
area are: who signs the transfer event? who *sends* the transfer event? how does a transfer start?

**TODO**: Likely to be done with an `m.room.hub` state event in the room, where the "current hub" is
either the sender of `m.room.hub` or `m.room.create` if no hub state event is present. Auth rules
would govern what makes for a legal `m.room.hub` event.

**TODO**: {{?I-D.kohbrok-mimi-portability}} may be of help here.

# Transport {#int-transport}

This document specifies a wire transport which uses JSON {{!RFC8259}} over HTTPS {{!RFC9110}}. Servers
MUST support a minimum of HTTP/2 {{!RFC9113}} and TLS 1.3 {{!RFC8446}}.

**TODO**: This transport doesn't scale, and doesn't use RESTful endpoints. This example transport is
heavily inspired by Matrix's existing Server-Server API, largely acting as a starting point for testing
interoperability of the access control semantics. A better option might be gRPC, which might change how
events are structured but keep the overall semantics the same. {{?I-D.rosenberg-mimi-protocol}} might
have ideas here as well for REST APIs.

## TLS Certificates {#int-tls}

Servers MUST provide a TLS certificate signed by a known Certificate Authority. Requesting servers
are ultimately responsible for the Certificate Authorities they place trust in, however servers
SHOULD trust authorities which would commonly be trusted by an operating system or web browser.

## API Standards

### Requests and Responses {#int-transport-requests-responses}

All HTTP `POST` and `PUT` endpoints require the sending server to supply a (potentially empty) JSON
object as the request body. Requesting servers SHOULD supply a `Content-Type` header of `application/json`
for such requests.

All endpoints which require a server to respond with a JSON object MUST include a `Content-Type` header
of `application/json`.

All JSON data, in requests or responses, MUST be encoded using UTF-8 {{!RFC3629}}.

All endpoints in this document do *not* support trailing slashes on them. When such a request is
encountered, it MUST be handled as an unknown endpoint ({{int-unknown-endpoints}}). Examples include:

* `https://example.org/_matrix/path` - valid.
* `https://example.org/_matrix/path/` - unknown/invalid.
* `https://example.org//_matrix/path` - unknown/invalid (domain also can't have a trailing slash).
* `https://example.org//_matrix/path/` - doubly unknown/invalid.

Servers (both hub and participants) MUST implement all endpoints unless otherwise specified.

Most endpoints have a version number as part of the path. This version number is that endpoint's version,
allowing for breaking changes to be made to the schema of that endpoint. For clarity, the version number
is *not* representative of an API version.

### Errors {#int-transport-errors}

All errors are represented by an error code defined by this document and an accompanied HTTP status code.
It is possible for a HTTP status code to map to multiple error codes, and it's possible for an error
code to map to multiple HTTP status codes.

When a server is returning an error to a caller, it MUST use the most appropriate error response defined
by the endpoint. If no appropriate error response is specified, the server SHOULD use `M_UNKNOWN` as the
error code and `500 Internal Server Error` as the HTTP status code.

Errors are represented as JSON objects, requiring a `Content-Type: application/json` response header:

~~~ json
{
  "errcode": "M_UNKNOWN",
  "error": "Something went wrong."
}
~~~

`errcode` is required and denotes the error code. `error` is an optional human-readable description of
the error. `error` can be as precise or vague as the responding server desires - the strings in this
document are suggestions.

Some common error codes are:

* `M_UNKNOWN` - An unknown error has occurred.
* `M_FORBIDDEN` - The caller is not permitted to access the resource. For example, trying to join a room
  the user does not have an invite for.
* `M_NOT_JSON` - The request did not contain valid JSON. Must be accompanied by a `400 Bad Request` HTTP
  status code.
* `M_BAD_JSON` - The request did contain valid JSON, but it was missing required keys or was malformed in
   another way. Must be accompanied by a `400 Bad Request` HTTP status code.
* `M_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` - Too many requests have been sent. The caller should wait before trying the request
  again.
* `M_TOO_LARGE` - The request was too large for the receiver to handle.

### Unsupported Endpoints {#int-unknown-endpoints}

If a server receives a request for an unsupported or otherwise unknown endpoint, the server MUST respond
with an HTTP `404 Not Found` status code and `M_UNRECOGNIZED` error code. If the request was for a known
endpoint, but wrong HTTP method, a `405 Method Not Allowed` HTTP status code and `M_UNRECOGNIZED` error
code ({{int-transport-errors}}).

### Malformed Requests

If a server is expecting JSON in the request body but receives something else, it MUST respond with an
HTTP status code of `400 Bad Request` and error code `M_NOT_JSON` ({{int-transport-errors}}). If the
request contains JSON, and is for a known endpoint, but otherwise missing required keys or is malformed,
the server MUST respond with an HTTP status code of `400 Bad Request` and error code `M_BAD_JSON`
({{int-transport-errors}}). Where possible, `error` for `M_BAD_JSON` should describe the missing keys
or other parsing error.

### Transaction Identifiers {#int-txn-ids}

Where endpoints use HTTP `PUT`, it is typical for a "transaction ID" to be specified in the path
parameters. This transaction ID MUST ONLY be used for making requests idempotent - if a server receives
two (or more) requests with the same transaction ID, it MUST return the same response for each and only
process the request body once. It is assumed that requests using the same transaction ID also contain
the same request body between calls.

A transaction ID only needs to be unique per-endpoint and per-sending server. A server's transaction IDs
do not affect requests made by other servers or made to other endpoints by the same server.

### Rate Limiting

Servers SHOULD implement rate limiting semantics to reduce the risk of being overloaded. Endpoints which
support being rate limited are annotated in this document.

If a rate limit is encountered, the server MUST respond with an HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` status code
and `M_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` error code ({{int-transport-errors}}). If applicable, the server should additionally
include a `retry_after_ms` integer field on the error response to denote how long the caller should
wait before retrying, in milliseconds.

~~~ json
{
  "errcode": "M_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
  "error": "Too many requests. Try again later.",
  "retry_after_ms": 10254
}
~~~

The exact rate limit mechanics are left as an implementation detail. A potential approach may be to
prevent repeated requests for the same resource at a high rate and ensuring a remote server does not
request more than a defined number of resources at a time.

## Resolving Server Names {#int-resolve-domain}

Before making an API request, the caller MUST resolve a server name ({{int-server-names}}) to an IP
address and port, suitable for HTTPS {{!RFC9110}} traffic.

A server MAY change the IP/port combination used for API endpoints using SRV DNS records {{!RFC2782}}.
Servers MAY additionally change which TLS certificate is presented by using `.well-known` delegation.

`.well-known` delegation (step 3 below) is recommended for its ease of configuration over SRV DNS records.

The target server MUST present a valid TLS certificate ({{int-tls}}) for the name described in each
step. Similarly, the requesting server MUST use an HTTP `Host` header matching the description in each
step.

Server developers should note that many of the DNS requirements for the steps below are typically handled
by the software language or library implicitly. It is rare that a DNS A record needs to be resolved manually,
for example.

Per {{int-server-names}}, a server name consists of `<hostname>[:<port>]`. The steps to convert that
server name to an IP address and port are:

1. If `<hostname>` has an explicit `<port>` is present, resolve `<hostname>` to
   an IP address using CNAME {{!RFC1034}} {{!RFC2181}}, AAAA {{!RFC3596}}, or A {{!RFC1035}} DNS
   records. Requests are made to the resolved IP address and port number.

   TLS certificate: `<hostname>` (always without port)

   Host header: `<hostname>:<port>`

2. A regular (non-Matrix) HTTPS request is made to `https://<hostname>/.well-known/matrix/server`,
   expecting the schema defined by {{int-wellknown}}. If the response is invalid (bad/not JSON, missing
   properties, non-200 response, etc), skip to Step 4. If the response is valid, the `m.server` property
   is parsed as `<delegated_hostname>[:<delegated_port>]`.

   1. If `<delegated_hostname>` has an explicit `<delegated_port>` is present, resolve
      `<delegated_hostname>` to an IP address using CNAME, AAAA, or A DNS records. Requests are made to the
      resolved IP address and port number.

      TLS certificate: `<delegated_hostname>` (always without port)

      Host header: `<delegated_hostname>:<delegated_port>`

   3. An SRV DNS record is resolved for `_matrix._tcp.<delegated_hostname>`. This may result in another
      hostname and port to be resolved using AAAA or A DNS records. Requests are made to the resolved IP
      address and port number.

      TLS certificate: `<delegated_hostname>`

      Host header: `<delegated_hostname>` (without port)

   4. If no SRV record is found, an IP address is resolved for `<delegated_hostname>` is resolved using
      CNAME, AAAA, or A DNS records. Requests are made to the resolved IP address with port number 8448.

      TLS certificate: `<delegated_hostname>`

      Host header: `<delegated_hostname>` (without port)

3. If the `.well-known` call from Step 2 resulted in an invalid response, an SRV DNS record is resolved
   for `_matrix._tcp.<hostname>`. This may result in another hostname and port to be resolved using AAAA
   or A DNS records. Requests are made to the resolved IP address and port number.

   TLS certificate: `<hostname>` (always without port)

   Host header: `<hostname>` (without port)

4. If the `.well-known` call from Step 3 resulted in an invalid response, and the SRV record from Step 4
   was not found, and IP address is resolved using CNAME, AAAA, or A DNS records. Requests are made to the
   resolved IP address and port 8448.

   TLS certificate: `<hostname>` (always without port)

   Host header: `<hostname>` (without port)

We require `<[delegated_]hostname>` rather than `<srv_hostname>` in Steps 2.3 and 3 for the following reasons:

1. DNS is largely insecure (not all domains use DNSSEC {{?RFC9364}}), so the target of the SRV record must
   prove it is a valid delegate/target for `<[delegated_]hostname>` via TLS.
2. {{Section 6.2.1 of RFC6125}} recommends this approach, and is consistent with other applications
   which use SRV records (such as {{Section 13.7.2.1 of RFC6120}}/XMPP).

Server implementations and owners should additionally note that the target of a SRV record MUST NOT be a CNAME,
as per RFC 2782 {{!RFC2782}}:

> the name MUST NOT be an alias (in the sense of RFC 1034 or RFC 2181)

{{!RFC1034}} {{!RFC2181}}

### `GET /.well-known/matrix/server` {#int-wellknown}

Used by the server name resolution approach to determine a delegated hostname for a given server. 30x HTTP
redirection MUST be followed, though loops SHOULD be avoided. Normal X.509 certificate validation is applied
to this endpoint (not the specific validation required by the server name resolution steps) {{?RFC5280}}.

This endpoint MAY be implemented by servers (it is optional).

**Rate-limited**: No.

**Authentication required**: No.

This HTTP endpoint does not specify any request parameters or body.

`200 OK` response:

~~~ json
{
   "m.server": "delegated.example.org:8448"
}
~~~

`m.server` is a required response field. Responses SHOULD have a `Content-Type` HTTP header of
`application/json`, however servers parsing the response should assume that the body is JSON regardless
of `Content-Type` header. Failures in parsing the JSON or otherwise invalid data that prevents parsing
MUST NOT result in discovery failure. Instead, the caller is expected to move on to the next step of
the name resolution approach.

Cache control headers SHOULD be respected on a `200 OK` response. Callers SHOULD impose a maximum
cache time of 48 hours, regardless of cache control headers. A default of 24 hours SHOULD be used
when no cache control headers are present.

Error responses (non-200) SHOULD be cached for no longer than 1 hour. Callers SHOULD exponentially
back off (to a defined limit) upon receiving repeated error responses.

## Request Authentication {#int-transport-auth}

Most endpoints in this document require authentication to prove which server is making the request.
This is done using public key digital signatures.

The request method, target, and body are represented as a JSON object, signed, and appended as an HTTP
`Authorization` header with an auth scheme of `X-Matrix`.

The object to be signed is:

~~~ json
{
   "method": "GET",
   "uri": "/path/to/endpoint?with_qs=true",
   "origin": "requesting.server.name.example.org",
   "destination": "target.server.name.example.org",
   "content": {"json_request_body": true}
}
~~~

`method` is the HTTP request method, capitalized. `uri` is the full request path, beginning with the
leading slash and containing the query string (if present). `uri` does not contain the `https:` scheme
or hostname.

**TODO**: Define an ordering algorithm for the query string (if we need to?).

`origin` and `destination` are the sender and receiver server names ({{int-server-names}}), respectively.

`content` is the JSON-encoded request body. When a request doesn't contain a body, such as in `GET`
requests, use an empty JSON object.

That object is then signed ({{int-signing-objects}}) by the requesting server. The resulting signature
is appended as an `Authentication` HTTP header on the request:

~~~
GET /path/to/endpoint?with_qs=true
Authorization: X-Matrix origin="requesting.server.name.example.org",
   destination="target.server.name.example.org",
   key="ed25519:0",
   sig="<unpadded base64 encoded signature>"
Content-Type: application/json

{"json_request_body": true}
~~~

Linebreaks within `Authorization` are for clarity and are non-normative.

The format of the Authorization header matches {{Section 11.4 of RFC9110}}. The header begins with an
authorization scheme of `X-Matrix`, followed by one or more spaces, followed by an (unordered)
comma-separated list of parameters written as name=value pairs. The names are case insensitive, though
the values are. The values must be enclosed in quotes if they contain characters which are not allowed
in a `token`, as defined by {{Section 5.6.2 of RFC9110}}. If a value is a valid `token` it may not be
enclosed in quotes. Quoted values MAY contain backslash-escaped characters. When parsing the header,
the recipient must unescape the characters.

The exact parameters are:

* `origin` - The name of the sending server. MUST match the `origin` in the signed JSON.
* `destination` - The name of the receiving server. MUST match the `destination` in the signed JSON.
* `key` - The ID, including algorithm name, of the sending server's signing key used to sign the request.
* `signature` - The unpadded base64 ({{int-unpadded-base64}}) encoded signature from step 2.

Unknown parameters are ignored and MUST NOT result in authentication errors.

A receiving server validates the Authorization header by composing the JSON object represented above
and checking the sender's signature ({{int-checking-signatures}}). Note that to comply with
{{int-checking-signatures}} the receiver may need to append a `signatures` field to the JSON object
manually. All signatures MUST use an unexpired key at the time of the request
({{int-transport-keys-validity}}).

A server with multiple signing keys SHOULD include an `Authorization` header for each signing key.

If an endpoint requires authentication, servers MUST:

* Validate all presented `Authorization` headers.
* Ensure at least one `Authorization` header is present.

If either fails (lack of headers, or any of the headers fail validation), the request MUST be rejected
with an HTTP `401 Unauthorized` status code and `M_FORBIDDEN` error code ({{int-transport-errors}}):

~~~ json
{
   "errcode": "M_FORBIDDEN",
   "error": "Signature error on request."
}
~~~

If an endpoint does *not* require authentication, `Authorization` headers are ignored entirely.

Responses from a server are authenticated using TLS and do not have additional signing requirements.

### Retrieving Server Keys {#int-transport-get-server-keys}

**TODO**: Explain what notaries are and what they do, if we keep this section at all.

A server's signing keys are published under `/_matrix/key/v2/server` ({{int-api-self-key}}) and can
be queried through notary servers in two ways: {{int-api-notary-query}} and {{int-api-notary-query-bulk}}.
Notary servers implicitly call `/_matrix/key/v2/server` when queried, signing and caching the response
for some time. This allows the target server to be offline without affecting their previously sent events.

The approach used here is borrowed from the Perspectives Project {{PerspectivesProject}}, modified to
cover the server's ed25519 keys and to use JSON instead of XML. The advantage of this system is it allows
each server to pick which notaries it trusts, and can contact multiple notaries to corroborate the keys
returned by any given notary.

Servers SHOULD attempt to contact the target server directly before using a notary server.

Note that these endpoints operate outside the context of a room: a server does not need to participate
in any shared rooms to be used as a notary by another server, and does not need to use the hub as a
notary.

#### Validity {#int-transport-keys-validity}

A server's keys are only valid for a short time, denoted by `valid_until_ts`. Around the `valid_until_ts`
timestamp, a server would re-fetch the server's keys to discover any changes. In the vast majority of
cases, only `valid_until_ts` changes between requests (keys are long-lived, but validated frequently).

`valid_until_ts` MUST be handled as the lesser of `valid_until_ts` and 7 days into the future, preventing
attackers from publishing long-lived keys that are unable to be revoked. Servers SHOULD use a timestamp
approximately 12 hours into the future when responding with their keys.

**TODO**: What does it mean to require events have an `origin_server_ts` which is less than that of
`valid_until_ts`? Do we reject the event, soft-fail it, or do something else? Do we only do this on the
hub?

#### `GET /_matrix/key/v2/server` {#int-api-self-key}

Retrieves the server's signing keys. The server can have any number of active or inactive keys at a
time, but SHOULD have at least 1 active key at all times.

**Rate-limited**: No.

**Authentication required**: No.

This HTTP endpoint does not specify any request parameters or body.

`200 OK` response:

~~~ json
{
   "server_name": "example.org",
   "valid_until_ts": 1686776437176,
   "m.linearized": true,
   "verify_keys": {
      "ed25519:0": {
         "key": "<unpadded base64 encoded public key>"
      }
   },
   "old_verify_keys": {
      "ed25519:bad": {
         "expired_ts": 1586776437176,
         "key": "<unpadded base64 encoded public key>"
      }
   },
   "signatures": {
      "example.org": {
         "ed25519:0": "<unpadded base64 encoded signature>"
      }
   }
}
~~~

`server_name` MUST be the name of the server ({{int-server-names}}) which is returning the keys.

`valid_until_ts` is the integer timestamp (milliseconds since Unix epoch) for when the server's keys
should be re-fetched. See {{int-transport-keys-validity}}.

`m.linearized` is an optional boolean, but SHOULD be set to `true`. Semantics for `false` and not
being present apply to contexts outside of this document.

`verify_keys` are the current signing keys for the server, keyed by key ID ({{int-signing}}). The
object value for each key ID under `verify_keys` is simply the `key`, consisting of the unpadded
base64 encoded public key matching that algorithm and version.

`old_verify_keys` are similar to `verify_keys`, but have an additional required `expired_ts` property
to denote when the key ceased usage. This overrides `valid_until_ts` for the purposes of
{{int-transport-keys-validity}} at an individual key level.

**TODO**: What about events sent with `old_verify_keys`?

For request authentication ({{int-transport-auth}}), only keys listed under `verify_keys` are honoured.
If another key is referenced by the `Authorization` headers, the request fails authentication.

Notaries SHOULD cache a 200 OK response for half of its lifetime to avoid serving stale values.
Responding servers SHOULD avoid returning responses which expire in less than an hour to avoid
repeated requests. Requesting servers SHOULD limit how frequently they query for keys to avoid
flooding a server with requests.

If the server fails to respond to this request, notaries SHOULD continue to return the last response
they received from the server so that the signatures of old events can still be checked, even if that
response is no longer considered valid ({{int-transport-keys-validity}}).

Servers are capable of rotating their keys without populating `old_verify_keys`, though this can cause
reliability issues if other servers don't see both keys. Notaries SHOULD cache responses with distinct
key IDs indefinitely. For example, if a server has `ed25519:0` and `ed25519:1` on its first response,
and a later response returns `ed25519:1` and `ed25519:2`, the notary should cache both responses. This
gives servers an ability to validate `ed25519:0` for old events in a room.

#### `GET /_matrix/key/v2/query/:serverName` {#int-api-notary-query}

This is one of two endpoints for querying a server's keys through another server. The notary (receiving)
server will attempt to refresh its cached copy of the target server's keys through `/_matrix/key/v2/server`,
falling back to any cached values if needed.

**Rate-limited**: No.

**Authentication required**: No.

Path parameters:

* `:serverName` - the target server's name ({{int-server-names}}) to retrieve keys for.

Query parameters:

* `minimum_valid_until_ts` (integer; optional) - The time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch the
  target server's keys will need to be valid until to be useful to the caller. If not specified the
  notary server's current time will be used.

Request body: None applicable.

`200 OK` response:

~~~ json
{
   "server_keys": [
      {/* server key */}
   ]
}
~~~

`server_keys` is the array of keys (see {{int-api-self-key}} response format) for the target server.
If the target server could not be reached and the notary has no cached keys, this array is empty. If
the keys do not meet `minimum_valid_until_ts` per {{int-transport-keys-validity}}, they are not included.

The notary server MUST sign each key returned in `server_keys` by at least one of its own signing keys.
The calling server MUST validate all signatures on the objects.

#### `POST /_matrix/key/v2/query` {#int-api-notary-query-bulk}

A bulk version of `/_matrix/key/v2/query/:serverName` ({{int-api-notary-query}}). The same behaviour
applies to this endpoint.

**Rate-limited**: No.

**Authentication required**: No.

Path parameters: None applicable.

Query parameters: None applicable.

Request body:

~~~ json
{
   "server_keys": {
      "example.org": {
         "ed25519:0": {
            "minimum_valid_until_ts": 1686783382189
         }
      }
   }
}
~~~

`server_keys` is required and is the search criteria. The object value is first keyed by server name
which maps to another object keyed by Key ID, mapping to the specific criteria. If no key IDs are
given in the request, all of the server's known keys are queried. If no servers are given in the
request, the response MUST contain an empty `server_keys` array.

`minimum_valid_until_ts` holds the same meaning as in {{int-api-notary-query}}.

`200 OK` response:

Same as {{int-api-notary-query}} with the following added detail:

Responding servers SHOULD only return signed key objects for the key IDs requested by the caller, however
servers MAY respond with more keys than requested. The caller is expected to filter the response if
needed.

## Sending Events {#int-transport-send-events}

Events accepted into the room by a hub server must be sent to all other servers in that room. Similarly,
participant servers need a way to send partial events through the hub server, as mentioned by {{int-lpdu}}.

A single endpoint is used for all rooms on either server, and can contain both fully-formed PDUs
({{int-pdu}}) or Linearized PDUs (partial events; {{int-lpdu}}) depending on the server's role in the
applicable room.

A typical event send path will be:

~~~ aasvg

   |                           |                     |
~~~

`PUT /send/:txnId` is shorthand for {{int-api-send-txn}}.

Hubs which generate events would skip to the point where they create a fully-formed PDU and send it
out to all other participants.

When a hub is broadcasting events to participant servers, it MUST include the following targets:

* The server implied by the `sender` for a kick or ban `m.room.member` ({{int-ev-member}}) event, up
  to the point of that kick or ban.
* All servers which have at least 1 user which is joined to the room.

### `PUT /_matrix/federation/v2/send/:txnId` {#int-api-send-txn}

Sends (L)PDUs ({{int-pdu}}, {{int-lpdu}}) to another server. The sending server MUST wait for a
`200 OK` response from the receiver before sending another request with a different `:txnId`.

**Implementation note**: Currently this endpoint doesn't actually exist. Use
`PUT /_matrix/federation/unstable/org.matrix.i-d.ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix.02/send/:txnId`
when testing against other Linearized Matrix implementations. This string may be updated later to
account for breaking changes.

**TODO**: Remove implementation notes.

**Rate-limited**: No.

**Authentication required**: Yes.

Path parameters:

* `:txnId` - the transaction ID ({{int-txn-ids}}) for the request.

Query parameters: None applicable.

Request body:

~~~ json
{
   "edus": [
      {/* EDU */}
   ],
   "pdus": [
      {/* Either an LPDU or PDU */}
   ]
}
~~~


`edus` are the Ephemeral Data Units ({{int-transport-edus}}) to send. If no EDUs are being sent, this
field MAY be excluded from the request body. There MUST NOT be more than 100 entries in `edus`.

`pdus` are the events/PDUs ({{int-pdu}}) and LPDUs ({{int-lpdu}}) to send to the server. Whether
it's an LPDU or PDU depends on the sending server's role in that room: if they are a non-hub server,
it will be an LPDU. There MUST NOT be more than 50 entries in `pdus`.

Each event in the `pdus` array gets processed as such:

1. Identify the room ID for the event. The exact format of the event can differ between room versions,
   however currently this would be done by extracting the `room_id` property.

   1. If that room ID is invalid/not found, the event is rejected.
   2. If the server is not participating in the room, the event is dropped/skipped.

2. If the event is an LPDU and the receiving server is the hub, the additional PDU fields are appended
   before continuing.

3. If the event is an LPDU and the receiving server is not the hub, the event is dropped/skipped.

4. The checks defined by {{int-receiving-events}} are performed.

5. If the event still hasn't been dropped/rejected, it is appended to the room. For participant servers,
   this may mean it's queued for sending to local clients.

Server implementation authors should note that these steps can be condensed, but are expanded here
for specification purposes. For example, an LPDU's signature can/will fail without ever needing to
append the PDU fields first - the server can skip some extra work this way.

`200 OK` response:

~~~ json
{
   "failed_pdus": {
      "$eventid": {
         "error": "Invalid event format"
      },
      "$eventid": {
         "error":
            "@alice:example.org cannot send m.room.power_levels"
      }
   }
}
~~~

The receiving server MUST NOT send a `200 OK` response until all events have been processed. Servers
SHOULD NOT block responding to this endpoint on sending accepted events to local clients or other
participant servers, as doing so could lead to a lengthy backlog of events waiting to be sent.

Sending servers SHOULD apply/expect a timeout and retry the exact same request with the same transaction
ID until they see a `200 OK` response. If the sending server attempts to send a different transaction
ID from the one already in flight, the receiving server MUST respond with a `400 Bad Request` HTTP
status code and `M_BAD_STATE` error code ({{int-transport-errors}}). Receiving servers SHOULD continue
processing requests to this endpoint even after the sender has disconnected/timed out, but SHOULD NOT
process the request multiple times due to the transaction ID ({{int-txn-ids}}).

`failed_pdus` is an object mapping event ID ({{int-pdu}}) to error string. Event IDs are based upon
the received object, not the final/complete object. For example, if an LPDU is sent, gets its PDU
fields appended, and fails event authorization, then the error would be for the event ID of the LPDU,
not the fully-formed PDU. This is to allow the sender to correlate what they sent with errors.

The object for each event ID MUST contain an `error` string field, representing the human-readable
reason for an event being rejected.

Events which are dropped/ignored or accepted do *not* appear in `failed_pdus`.

**TODO**: Should we also return fully-formed PDUs for the LPDUs we received?

## Event and State APIs

When a participant in the room is missing an event, or otherwise needs a new copy of it, it can retrieve
that event from the hub server. Similar mechanics apply for getting state events, current state of a room,
and backfilling scrollback in a room.

All servers are required to implement all endpoints ({{int-transport-requests-responses}}), however
only hub servers are guaranteed to have the full history/state for a room. While other participant
servers might have history, they SHOULD NOT be contacted due to the high likelihood of a Not Found-style
error.

### `GET /_matrix/federation/v2/event/:eventId`

Retrieves a single event.

**Implementation note**: Currently this endpoint doesn't actually exist. Use
`GET /_matrix/federation/unstable/org.matrix.i-d.ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix.02/event/:eventId`
when testing against other Linearized Matrix implementations. This string may be updated later to
account for breaking changes.

**TODO**: Remove implementation notes.

**Rate-limited**: Yes.

**Authentication required**: Yes.

Path parameters:

* `:eventId` - the event ID ({{int-pdu}}) to retrieve. Note that event IDs are typically reference
  hashes ({{int-reference-hashes}}) of the event itself, which includes the room ID. This makes
  event IDs globally unique.

Query parameters: None applicable.

Request body: None applicable.

`200 OK` response:

~~~ json
{
   /* the event */
}
~~~

The response body is simply the event ({{int-pdu}}) itself, if the requesting server has reasonable
visibility of the event ({{int-calc-event-visibility}}). When the server can see an event but not the
contents, the event is served redacted ({{int-redactions}}) instead.

If the event isn't known to the server, or the requesting server has no reason to know that the event
even exists, a `404 Not Found` HTTP status code and `M_NOT_FOUND` error code ({{int-transport-errors}})
is returned.

The returned event MUST be checked before being used by the requesting server ({{int-receiving-events}}).
This endpoint MUST NOT return LPDUs ({{int-lpdu}}), instead treating such events as though they didn't
exist.

### `GET /_matrix/federation/v1/state/:roomId` {#int-api-get-state}

Retrieves a snapshot of the room state ({{int-state-events}}) at the given event. This is typically
most useful when a participant server prefers to store minimal information about the room, but still
needs to offer context to its clients.

**Rate-limited**: Yes.

**Authentication required**: Yes.

Path parameters:

* `:roomId` - the room ID ({{int-room-id}}) to retrieve state in.

Query parameters:

* `event_id` (string; required) - The event ID ({{int-pdu}}) to retrieve state at.

Request body: None applicable.

`200 OK` response:

~~~ json
{
   "auth_chain": [
      {/* event */}
   ],
   "pdus": [
      {/* event */}
   ]
}
~~~

The returned room state is in two parts: the `pdus`, consisting of the events which represent "current
state" ({{int-state-events}}) prior to considering state changes induced by the event in the original
request, and `auth_chain`, consisting of the events which make up the `auth_events` ({{int-auth-selection}})
for the `pdus` and the `auth_events` of those events, recursively.

The `auth_chain` will eventually stop recursing when it reaches the `m.room.create` event, as it cannot
have any `auth_events`.

**TODO**: Do we actually need to recurse auth events to get the full auth chain here? What are participant
servers expected to do with this information? (Do they even care about it?)

For example, if the requested event ID was an `m.room.power_levels` event, the returned state would be
as if the new power levels were not applied.

Both `auth_chain` and `pdus` contain event objects ({{int-pdu}}).

If the requesting server does not have reasonable visibility on the room ({{int-calc-event-visibility}}),
or either the room ID or event ID don't exist, a `404 Not Found` HTTP status code and `M_NOT_FOUND`
error code ({{int-transport-errors}}) is returned. The same error is returned if the event ID doesn't
exist in the requested room ID.

Note that the requesting server will generally always have visibility of the `auth_chain` and `pdu`
events, but may not be able to see their contents. In this case, they are redacted ({{int-redactions}})
before being served.

The returned events MUST be checked before being used by the requesting server ({{int-receiving-events}}).
This endpoint MUST NOT return LPDUs ({{int-lpdu}}), instead treating such events as though they didn't
exist.

If the receiving server is not the hub server for the room ID, an HTTP status code of `400 Bad Request`
and error code `M_WRONG_SERVER` ({{int-transport-errors}}) is returned.

### `GET /_matrix/federation/v1/state_ids/:roomId`

This performs the same function as {{int-api-get-state}} but returns just the event IDs instead.

**Rate-limited**: Yes.

**Authentication required**: Yes.

Path parameters:

* `:roomId` - the room ID ({{int-room-id}}) to retrieve state in.

Query parameters:

* `event_id` (string; required) - The event ID ({{int-pdu}}) to retrieve state at.

Request body: None applicable.

`200 OK` response:

~~~ json
{
   "auth_chain_ids": ["$event1", "$event2"],
   "pdu_ids": ["$event3", "$event4"]
}
~~~

See {{int-api-get-state}} for behaviour. Note that `auth_chain` becomes `auth_chain_ids` when using
this endpoint, and `pdus` becomes `pdu_ids`.

### `GET /_matrix/federation/v2/backfill/:roomId`

Retrieves a sliding window history of previous events in a given room.

**Implementation note**: Currently this endpoint doesn't actually exist. Use
`GET /_matrix/federation/unstable/org.matrix.i-d.ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix.02/backfill/:roomId`
when testing against other Linearized Matrix implementations. This string may be updated later to
account for breaking changes.

**TODO**: Remove implementation notes.

**Rate-limited**: Yes.

**Authentication required**: Yes.

Path parameters:

* `:roomId` - the room ID ({{int-room-id}}) to retrieve events from.

Query parameters:

* `v` (string; required) - The event ID ({{int-pdu}}) to start backfilling from.
* `limit` (integer; required) - The maximum number of events to return, including `v`.

Request body: None applicable.

`200 OK` response:

~~~ json
{
   "pdus": [
      {/* event */}
   ]
}
~~~

The number of returned `pdus` MUST NOT exceed the `limit` provided by the caller. `limit` SHOULD have
a maximum value imposed by the receiving server. `pdus` contains the events ({{int-pdu}}) preceeding
the requested event ID (`v`), including `v`. `pdus` is ordered from oldest to newest.

If the requesting server does not have reasonable visibility on the room ({{int-calc-event-visibility}}),
or either the room ID or event ID don't exist, a `404 Not Found` HTTP status code and `M_NOT_FOUND`
error code ({{int-transport-errors}}) is returned. The same error is returned if the event ID doesn't
exist in the requested room ID.

If the requesting server does have visibility on the returned events, but not their contents, they
are redacted ({{int-redactions}}) before being served.

The returned events MUST be checked before being used by the requesting server ({{int-receiving-events}}).
This endpoint MUST NOT return LPDUs ({{int-lpdu}}), instead treating such events as though they didn't
exist.

## Room Membership {#int-transport-room-membership}

When a server is already participating in a room, it can simply send `m.room.member` ({{int-ev-member}})
events with the `/send` API ({{int-api-send-txn}}) to other servers/the hub directly. When a server is
not already participating however, it needs to be welcomed in by the hub server.

A typical invite flow would be:

`POST /invite` is shorthand for {{int-api-invite}}. Similarly, `GET /make_join` is {{int-api-make-join}}
and `POST /send_join` is {{int-api-send-join}}.

If the user decided to reject the invite, the TargetServer would use `GET /make_leave` ({{int-api-make-leave}})
and `POST /send_leave` ({{int-api-send-leave}}) instead of make/send_join.

### Make and Send Handshake {#int-transport-make-and-send}

When a server is already participating in a room, it can use `m.room.member` ({{int-ev-member}}) events
and the `/send` API ({{int-api-send-txn}}) to directly change membership. When the server is not already
involved in the room, such as when being invited for the first time, the server needs to "make" an event
and "send" it through the hub server to append it to the room.

The different processes which use this handshake are:

* Rejecting Invites ({{int-transport-leaves}})
* Joins ({{int-transport-joins}})
* Knocks ({{int-transport-knocks}})

The "make" portion of the endpoints take the shape of `GET /_matrix/federation/v1/make_CHANGE/:roomId/:userId`,
where `CHANGE` is `leave`, `join`, or `knock` (respective to the list above). This endpoint will
return a partial LPDU ({{int-lpdu}}) which needs to be turned into a full LPDU and signed before being
sent using `POST /_matrix/federation/v3/send_CHANGE/:txnId`.

The flow for this handshake appears as such:

~~~

Note that the `send_CHANGE` step re-checks the event against the auth rules: any amount of time
could have passed between the `make_CHANGE` and `send_CHANGE` calls.

**TODO**: Describe how the external server is meant to find the hub. Invites work by (usually) trying
to contact the server which sent the invite, but knocking is a guess.

### Invites {#int-transport-invites}

When inviting a user belonging to a server already in the room, senders SHOULD use `m.room.member`
({{int-ev-member}}) events and the `/send` API ({{int-api-send-txn}}). This section's endpoints SHOULD
only be used when the target server is *not* participating in the room already.

Note that being invited does not count as the server "participating" in the room. This can mean that
while a server has a user with a pending invite in the room, this section's endpoints are needed to
send additional invites to other users on the same server.

The full invite sequence is:

`POST /invite` is shorthand for {{int-api-invite}}.

What causes a user to be considered "ineligible" for an invite is left as an implementation detail.
See {{int-user-privacy}} and {{int-spam}} for suggestions on handling user-level privacy controls and
spam invites.

#### `POST /_matrix/federation/v3/invite/:txnId` {#int-api-invite}

Sends an invite event to a server. If the sender is a participant server, the receiving server (the
hub) will convert the contained LPDU ({{int-lpdu}}) to a fully-formed event ({{int-pdu}}) before sending
that event to the intended server.

**Implementation note**: Currently this endpoint doesn't actually exist. Use
`POST /_matrix/federation/unstable/org.matrix.i-d.ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix.02/invite/:txnId`
when testing against other Linearized Matrix implementations. This string may be updated later to
account for breaking changes.

**TODO**: Remove implementation notes.

**Rate-limited**: Yes.

**Authentication required**: Yes.

Path parameters:

* `:txnId` - the transaction ID ({{int-txn-ids}}) for the request. The event ID ({{int-pdu}}) of the
  contained event may be a good option as a readily-available transaction ID.

Query parameters: None applicable.

Request body:

~~~ json
{
   "event": {/* the event */},
   "invite_room_state": [/* stripped state events */],
   "room_version": "I.1"
}
~~~

`invite_room_state` are the stripped state events ({{int-stripped-state}}) for the room's current
state. `invite_room_state` MAY be excluded from the request body.

`room_version` is the room version identifier ({{int-room-versions}}) the room is currently using. This
will be retrieved from the `m.room.create` ({{int-ev-create}}) state event.

`event` is the event (LPDU or PDU; {{int-pdu}}) representing the invite for the user. It MUST meet
the following criteria, in addition to the requirements of an event:

* `type` MUST be `m.room.member`.
* `membership` in `content` MUST be `invite`.

When the hub server receives a request from a participant server, it MUST populate the event fields
before sending the event to the intended recipient. This means running the event through the normal
event authorization steps ({{int-auth-rules}}). If the invite is not allowed under the auth rules,
the server responds with a `403 Forbidden` HTTP status code and `M_FORBIDDEN` error code ({{int-transport-errors}}).

The intended recipient of the invite can be identified by the `state_key` on the event.

If the invite event is valid, the hub server sends its own `POST /_matrix/federation/v3/invite/:txnId`
request to the target server (if the target server is not itself) with the fully-formed event. The
transaction ID does not need to be the same as the original inbound request.

All responses from the target server SHOULD be proxied verbatim to the original requesting server
through the hub. The hub SHOULD discard what appears to be excess data before sending a response
to the requesting server, such as extra or large fields. If the target server does not respond with
JSON, an error response ({{int-transport-errors}}) SHOULD be sent by the hub instead.

The target server then ensures it can support the room version. If it can't, it responds with an HTTP
status code of `400 Bad Request` and error code of `M_INCOMPATIBLE_ROOM_VERSION` ({{int-transport-errors}}).

Then, the target server runs any implementation-specific checks as needed, such as those implied by
{{int-user-privacy}} and {{int-spam}}, rejecting/erroring the request as needed.

Finally, the target server signs the event and returns it to the hub. The hub server appends this signed
event to the room and sends it out to all participants in the room. The signed event is additionally
returned to the originating participant server, though it also receives the event through the `/send`
API ({{int-api-send-txn}}).

`200 OK` response:

~~~ json
{
   "pdu": {/* signed fully-formed event */}
}
~~~

Note that by the time a response is received, the event is signed 2-3 times:

1. The LPDU signature from the participant server ({{int-lpdu}}).
2. The hub's signature on the PDU ({{int-pdu}}).
3. The target server's signature on the PDU.

These signatures are to satisfy the auth rules ({{int-auth-rules}}).

**TODO**: Do we ever validate the target server's signature? Do we need to?

#### Rejecting Invites and Leaves {#int-transport-leaves}

Rejecting an invite is done by making a membership transition of `invite` to `leave` through the user's
`m.room.member` ({{int-ev-member}}) event. The membership event SHOULD be sent directly when it can and
use the "make and send" handshake ({{int-transport-make-and-send}}) described here otherwise.

This same approach is additionally used to retract a knock ({{int-transport-knocks}}).

##### `GET /_matrix/federation/v1/make_leave/:roomId/:userId` {#int-api-make-leave}

Requests an event template from the hub server for a room. The requesting server will have already
been checked to ensure it supports the room version as part of the invite process prior to making a
call to this endpoint.

**Rate-limited**: Yes.

**Authentication required**: Yes.

Path parameters:

* `:roomId` - the room ID ({{int-room-id}}) to get a template for.
* `:userId` - the user ID ({{int-user-id}}) attempting to leave.

Query parameters: None applicable.

Request body: None applicable.

`200 OK` response:

~~~ json
{
   "event": {/* partial LPDU */},
   "room_version": "I.1"
}
~~~

The response body's `event` MUST be a partial LPDU ({{int-lpdu}}) with at least the following fields:

* `type` of `m.room.member`.
* `state_key` of `:userId` from the path parameters.
* `sender` of `:userId` from the path parameters.
* `content` of `{"membership": "leave"}`.

The sending server SHOULD remove all other fields before using the event in a `send_leave` ({{int-api-send-leave}}).

If the receiving server is not the hub server for the room ID, an HTTP status code of `400 Bad Request`
and error code `M_WRONG_SERVER` ({{int-transport-errors}}) is returned. If the room ID is not known,
`404 Not Found` is used as an HTTP status code and `M_NOT_FOUND` as an error code ({{int-transport-errors}}).

If the user does not have permission to leave under the auth rules ({{int-auth-rules}}), a `403 Forbidden`
HTTP status code is returned alongside an error code of `M_FORBIDDEN` ({{int-transport-errors}}). For example,
if the user does not have a pending invite, is not a member of the room, or is banned.

If the sending server does not recognize the returned `room_version`, it SHOULD NOT attempt to populate
the template or use the `send_leave` ({{int-api-send-leave}}) endpoint.

##### `POST /_matrix/federation/v3/send_leave/:txnId` {#int-api-send-leave}

Sends a leave membership event to the room through a hub server.

**Implementation note**: Currently this endpoint doesn't actually exist. Use
`POST /_matrix/federation/unstable/org.matrix.i-d.ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix.02/send_leave/:txnId`
when testing against other Linearized Matrix implementations. This string may be updated later to
account for breaking changes.

**TODO**: Remove implementation notes.

**Rate-limited**: Yes.

**Authentication required**: Yes.

Path parameters:

* `:txnId` - the transaction ID ({{int-txn-ids}}) for the request. The event ID ({{int-pdu}}) of the
  contained event may be a good option as a readily-available transaction ID.

Query parameters: None applicable.

Request body:

~~~ json
{
   /* LPDU created from make_leave template */
}
~~~

`200 OK` response:

~~~ json
{/* deliberately empty object */}
~~~

The errors responses from `/make_leave` ({{int-api-make-leave}}) are copied here. Servers should note
that room state MAY change between a `/make_leave` and `/send_leave`, potentially in a way which
prevents the user from leaving the room suddenly. For example, the invited user may have been banned
from the room.

### Joins {#int-transport-joins}

Joins for users SHOULD be sent directly whenever possible, and otherwise use the "make and send" handshake
({{int-transport-make-and-send}}) approach described here.

#### `GET /_matrix/federation/v1/make_join/:roomId/:userId` {#int-api-make-join}

Requests an event template from the hub server for a room. This is done to ensure the requesting
server supports the room's version ({{int-room-versions}}), as well as hint at the event format
needed to participate.

Note that this endpoint is extremely similar to `/make_leave` ({{int-api-make-leave}}).

**Rate-limited**: Yes.

**Authentication required**: Yes.

Path parameters:

* `:roomId` - the room ID ({{int-room-id}}) to get a template for.
* `:userId` - the user ID ({{int-user-id}}) attempting to join.

Query parameters:

* `ver` (string; required; repeated) - The room versions ({{int-room-versions}}) the sending server
  supports.

Request body: None applicable.

`200 OK` response:

~~~ json
{
   /* partial LPDU */
}
~~~

The response body MUST be a partial LPDU ({{int-lpdu}}) with at least the following fields:

* `type` of `m.room.member`.
* `state_key` of `:userId` from the path parameters.
* `sender` of `:userId` from the path parameters.
* `content` of `{"membership": "join"}`.

The sending server SHOULD remove all other fields before using the event in a `send_join` ({{int-api-send-join}}).

If the receiving server is not the hub server for the room ID, an HTTP status code of `400 Bad Request`
and error code `M_WRONG_SERVER` ({{int-transport-errors}}) is returned. If the room ID is not known,
`404 Not Found` is used as an HTTP status code and `M_NOT_FOUND` as an error code ({{int-transport-errors}}).

If the user does not have permission to join under the auth rules ({{int-auth-rules}}), a `403 Forbidden`
HTTP status code is returned alongside an error code of `M_FORBIDDEN` ({{int-transport-errors}}).

If the room version is not one of the `ver` strings the sender supplied, a `400 Bad Request` HTTP status
code is returned alongside `M_INCOMPATIBLE_ROOM_VERSION` error code ({{int-transport-errors}}).

#### `POST /_matrix/federation/v3/send_join/:txnId` {#int-api-send-join}

Sends a join membership event to the room through a hub server.

Note that this endpoint is extremely similar to `/send_leave` ({{int-api-send-leave}}).

**Implementation note**: Currently this endpoint doesn't actually exist. Use
`POST /_matrix/federation/unstable/org.matrix.i-d.ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix.02/send_join/:txnId`
when testing against other Linearized Matrix implementations. This string may be updated later to
account for breaking changes.

**TODO**: Remove implementation notes.

**Rate-limited**: Yes.

**Authentication required**: Yes.

Path parameters:

* `:txnId` - the transaction ID ({{int-txn-ids}}) for the request. The event ID ({{int-pdu}}) of the
  contained event may be a good option as a readily-available transaction ID.

Query parameters: None applicable.

**TODO**: Incorporate faster joins work.

Request body:

~~~ json
{
   /* LPDU created from make_join template */
}
~~~

`200 OK` response:

~~~ json
{
   "state": [/* events */],
   "auth_chain": [/* events */],
   "event": {/* fully-formed event */}
}
~~~

`state` is the current room state, consisting of the events which represent "current state" ({{int-state-events}})
prior to considering the membership state change. `auth_chain` consists of the events which make up
the `auth_events` ({{int-auth-selection}}) for the `state` events, and the `auth_events` of those events,
recursively. `event` will be the fully-formed PDU ({{int-pdu}}) that is sent by the hub to all other
participants in the room.

The errors responses from `/make_join` ({{int-api-make-join}}) are copied here (with the exception
of `M_INCOMPATIBLE_ROOM_VERSION`, as the server already checked for support). Servers should note
that room state MAY change between a `/make_join` and `/send_join`, potentially in a way which
prevents the user from joining the room suddenly.

### Knocks {#int-transport-knocks}

To knock on a room is to request an invite to that room. It is not a join, nor is it an invite itself.
"Approving" the knock is done by inviting the user, which is typically only allowed by moderators in
these rooms. "Denying" the knock is done through kicking (sending a `leave` membership) or banning the
user. If the user is kicked, they may re-send their knock.

Senders should note the `reason` field on `m.room.member` events ({{int-ev-member}}) to provide context
for their knock.

To retract a knock, the sending server uses the same APIs as rejecting an invite ({{int-transport-leaves}}).

Where possible, knocks from users SHOULD be sent directly, otherwise using the "make and send" handshake
({{int-transport-make-and-send}}) approach described here.

#### `GET /_matrix/federation/v1/make_knock/:roomId/:userId` {#int-api-make-knock}

Requests an event template from the hub server for a room. This is done to ensure the requesting
server supports the room's version ({{int-room-versions}}), as well as hint at the event format
needed to participate.

Note that this endpoint is almost exactly the same as `/make_join` ({{int-api-make-join}}).

**TODO**: It's so similar to make_join that we should probably just combine the two endpoints.

**Rate-limited**: Yes.

**Authentication required**: Yes.

Path parameters:

* `:roomId` - the room ID ({{int-room-id}}) to get a template for.
* `:userId` - the user ID ({{int-user-id}}) attempting to knock.

Query parameters:

* `ver` (string; required; repeated) - The room versions ({{int-room-versions}}) the sending server
  supports.

Request body: None applicable.

`200 OK` response:

~~~ json
{
   /* partial LPDU */
}
~~~

The response body MUST be a partial LPDU ({{int-lpdu}}) with at least the following fields:

* `type` of `m.room.member`.
* `state_key` of `:userId` from the path parameters.
* `sender` of `:userId` from the path parameters.
* `content` of `{"membership": "knock"}`.

The sending server SHOULD remove all other fields before using the event in a `send_knock` ({{int-api-send-knock}}).

If the receiving server is not the hub server for the room ID, an HTTP status code of `400 Bad Request`
and error code `M_WRONG_SERVER` ({{int-transport-errors}}) is returned. If the room ID is not known,
`404 Not Found` is used as an HTTP status code and `M_NOT_FOUND` as an error code ({{int-transport-errors}}).

If the user does not have permission to knock under the auth rules ({{int-auth-rules}}), a `403 Forbidden`
HTTP status code is returned alongside an error code of `M_FORBIDDEN` ({{int-transport-errors}}).

If the room version is not one of the `ver` strings the sender supplied, a `400 Bad Request` HTTP status
code is returned alongside `M_INCOMPATIBLE_ROOM_VERSION` error code ({{int-transport-errors}}).

#### `POST /_matrix/federation/v3/send_knock/:txnId` {#int-api-send-knock}

Sends a knock membership event to the room through a hub server.

**Implementation note**: Currently this endpoint doesn't actually exist. Use
`POST /_matrix/federation/unstable/org.matrix.i-d.ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix.02/send_knock/:txnId`
when testing against other Linearized Matrix implementations. This string may be updated later to
account for breaking changes.

**TODO**: Remove implementation notes.

**Rate-limited**: Yes.

**Authentication required**: Yes.

Path parameters:

* `:txnId` - the transaction ID ({{int-txn-ids}}) for the request. The event ID ({{int-pdu}}) of the
  contained event may be a good option as a readily-available transaction ID.

Query parameters: None applicable.

Request body:

~~~ json
{
   /* LPDU created from make_knock template */
}
~~~

`200 OK` response:

~~~ json
{
   "stripped_state": [
      /* stripped state events */
   ]
}
~~~

`stripped_state` are the stripped state events ({{int-stripped-state}}) for the room.

The errors responses from `/make_knock` ({{int-api-make-knock}}) are copied here (with the exception
of `M_INCOMPATIBLE_ROOM_VERSION`, as the server already checked for support). Servers should note
that room state MAY change between a `/make_knock` and `/send_knock`, potentially in a way which
prevents the user from knocking upon the room suddenly.

## Content Repository

The content repository, sometimes called the "media repo", is where user-generated content is stored
for referencing within an encrypted message.

**TODO**: Complete this section. We want auth/event linking from MSC3911 and MSC3916.

**TODO**: Spell out that content is images, videos, files, etc.

## Ephemeral Data Units (EDUs) {#int-transport-edus}

EDUs are sent out of band from rooms and are only persisted for exactly as long as they are needed.
For example, once a to-device ({{int-transport-to-device}}) message is delivered to a client, the
server may easily be able to delete its copy of the message.

EDUs contain the following mandatory fields:

~~~ json
{
   "type": "m.room.encrypted",
   "sender": "@alice:example.org",
   "content": {
      /* type-specific content */
   }
}
~~~

The `type` is similar to an event type ({{int-pdu}}) and ultimately describes the schema for the
`content`.

`sender_id` is the user ID ({{int-user-id}}) which is sending the EDU. Typically, clients will not
generate EDUs directly. Instead, the server will convert a client's request into an EDU for sending
to a remote server, where that server then unpacks the EDU before delivering it to local devices.

Because EDUs are not sent in the context of a room, even if an MLS `Welcome` message is being sent
for a room, servers MUST send the EDUs directly to the target server with the send API ({{int-api-send-txn}}).

In this document, EDUs are only used for to-device messages ({{int-transport-to-device}}) and device
list changes ({{int-transport-devices}}), but could be used for read/delivery receipts, typing notifications,
and more in future. This may necessitate routing EDUs through the hub rather than using full-mesh fanout.

**TODO**: Address EDU fanout; Document the implied missing features (receipts, typing notifs).

## MLS {#int-transport-mls}

**TODO**: This section. Talk about to-device messaging, device management/querying/key claiming, etc.

There are several endpoints required by this document's MLS implementation ({{int-mls-considerations}}),
largely around device management for each device's signing key, claiming key packages for those devices,
and sending messages (`Welcome` in particular) after using a key package.

### Device Info Publishing {#int-transport-devices}

When a user creates a new encryption-capable device, or removes one, a "device list update" is sent
to all servers the user shares a room with. The receiving servers then determine which local clients
need to be made aware of the device list change and sends the information to them. This is primarily
used by this document's MLS implementation ({{int-mls-considerations}}) to indicate to other devices
that either a new possible device has come online or that another needs to be removed from some MLS
groups due to being deleted.

Typically, a device is created by a user when they log in to a new session. Similarly, a device is
deleted/removed when they log out of that client.

The device list update takes the shape of an EDU ({{int-transport-edus}}), as such:

~~~ json
{
   "type": "m.device_list_update",
   "sender_id": "@alice:example.org",
   "content": {
      "changed": [/* Device Objects */],
      "removed": [/* Device IDs */]
   }
}
~~~

The device objects are the same as in the response for `/user/:userId/device/:deviceId` ({{int-api-get-device}}),
indicating that either a new device was created or that information about a previous device has changed.

**TODO**: Matrix's `m.device_list_update` EDU is *very* different from this, and relatively complicated.
Do we actually need a `stream_id`, like in Matrix? Do we then need the `/devices` endpoint?

#### `GET /_matrix/federation/v1/user/:userId/device/:deviceId` {#int-api-get-device}

Retrieves information about a specific device for a user. This request does not go via a hub, instead
going directly to the server which owns the `:userId`.

**Implementation note**: Currently this endpoint doesn't actually exist. Use
`PUT /_matrix/federation/unstable/org.matrix.i-d.ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix.02/user/:userId/device/:deviceId`
when testing against other Linearized Matrix implementations. This string may be updated later to
account for breaking changes.

**TODO**: Remove implementation notes.

**Rate-limited**: Yes.

**Authentication required**: Yes.

Path parameters:

* `:userId` - the user ID ({{int-user-id}}) who owns the device.
* `:deviceId` - the device ID ({{int-device-id}}) to get information about.

Query parameters: None applicable.

Request body: None applicable.

`200 OK` response:

~~~ json
{
   "device_id": "ABCDEF",
   "user_id": "@alice:example.org",
   "algorithms": [
      "m.mls.v1.dhkemx25519-aes128gcm-sha256-ed25519"
   ],
   "keys": {
      "m.mls.v1.credential.ed25519:ABCDEF":
         "<unpadded base64 BasicCredential>"
   },
   "signatures": {
      "@alice:example.org": {
         "m.mls.v1.credential.ed25519:ABCDEF":
            "<unpadded base64 signature>"
      }
   }
}
~~~

Note that the response is the same object the device itself signed/created in {{int-mls-credentials}}.

If the user ID does not belong the receiving server, a `404 Not Found` HTTP status code is returned
with error code `M_NOT_FOUND` ({{int-transport-errors}}). The same applies if the user ID does not
exist, or the user does not have the device ID requested.

### To-Device Messaging {#int-transport-to-device}

To-device messaging is an ability to send information directly to another device, typically to carry
MLS `Welcome` messages and similar. They are sent as EDUs ({{int-transport-edus}}), one per receipient
device and payload:

~~~ json
{
   "type": "m.direct_to_device",
   "sender": "@alice:example.org",
   "content": {
      "target": "@bob:example.org",
      "target_device": "ABCD",
      "message_type": "m.room.encrypted",
      "message": {
         /* message_type-specific schema */
      }
   }
}
~~~

`target` and `target_device` denote the destination user ID ({{int-user-id}}) and device ID ({{int-device-id}})
for that user. This EDU MUST be sent to the server denoted by the target user ID. If the target user
doesn't exist or doesn't have a device with the ID described, the receiving server drops/ignores the
EDU.

See {{int-mls-add-remove}} for an example of a to-device message being used.

### One Time Key Claiming {#int-transport-key-claim}

To enable two devices to communicate, they need to claim a key package ({{int-mls-key-packages}})
for the other device. These key packages are also called "one time keys". This is done through the
following endpoint.

#### `POST /_matrix/federation/v1/user/keys/claim`

Claims one time keys for devices. This request does not go via a hub, instead going directly to the
server which owns the given user IDs.

**Rate-limited**: Yes.

**Authentication required**: Yes.

Path parameters: None applicable.

Query parameters: None applicable.

Request body:

~~~ json
{
  "one_time_keys": {
    "@alice:example.org": {
      "ABCD":
        "m.mls.v1.key_package.dhkemx25519-aes128gcm-sha256-ed25519"
    }
  }
}
~~~

`one_time_keys` MUST be specified and is a map of user ID ({{int-user-id}}) to device ID ({{int-device-id}})
to algorithm for the key package to claim. Currently the only expected algorithm is defined by {{int-mls-key-packages}}.

Any user IDs which don't belong to the receiving server, or which don't exist, are ignored. The same
applies for device IDs for which the user doesn't have.

`200 OK` response:

~~~ json
{
  "one_time_keys": {
    "@alice:example.org": {
      "ABCD": {
        "m.mls.v1.key_package.dhkemx25519-aes128gcm-sha256-ed25519":
          "<unpadded base64 encoded key package>"
      }
    }
  }
}
~~~

Like the request body, `one_time_keys` MUST be specified (but MAY be empty) and is a map of requested
user ID to requested device ID to algorithm name. The value for the algorithm name is dependent on the
algorithm itself. For `m.mls.v1.key_package.dhkemx25519-aes128gcm-sha256-ed25519`, this is an unpadded
base64 ({{int-unpadded-base64}}) string representing the key package itself.

Servers MUST NOT reuse a device's one time key, unless that key permits it. For example, MLS's "last
resort" key MAY be used multiple times, but SHOULD only be used if no other one time keys remain for
the device. Servers MUST NOT use an expired key.

Typically, the server will inform the device that a key was used so the device can upload additional
keys. See {{int-mls-key-packages}} for further implementation-related concerns.

## TODO: Remainder of Transport

**TODO**: This section.

Topics:

* More EDUs (typing notifications, receipts, presence)
* Query APIs (alias resolution, profiles)
* Other Encryption APIs??
* Server ACLs? (this probably should become part of the auth rules)

Notably/deliberately missing APIs are:

* `get_missing_events` - this is used by DAG servers only
* Public room directory
* Timestamp-to-event API
* All of 3rd party invites
* All of Spaces
* OpenID API

### Open Questions

* Should we include `/_matrix/federation/v1/version` in here? It's used by federation testers, but not
really anything else.

# User Privacy {#int-user-privacy}

**TODO**: Fully complete this section.

Messaging providers may have user-level settings to prevent unexpected or unwarranted invites, such
as automatically blocking invites from non-contacts. This setting can be upheld by returning an error
on `POST /_matrix/federation/v3/invite/:txnId` ({{int-api-invite}}), and by having the server (optionally)
auto-decline any invites received directly through `PUT /_matrix/federation/v2/send/:txnId` ({{int-api-send-txn}}).
See {{int-transport-leaves}} for more information on rejecting invites.

# Spam Prevention {#int-spam}

**TODO**: Fully complete this section.

**TODO**: Talk about how to deal with spammy/unwanted invites.

Servers MAY temporarily or permanently block a room entirely by using the room ID. Typically, when a
room becomes blocked, all local users will be removed from the room using `m.room.member` events with
`membership` of `leave` ({{int-ev-member}}). Then, any time the server receives a request for that
room ID it can reject it with an error response ({{int-transport-errors}}).

Blocking a room does not block it from all servers, but does prevent users on a server from accessing
the content within. This is primarily useful to remove a server from rooms where abusive/illegal content
is shared.

# Security Considerations

**TODO**: Expand upon this section.

With the combined use of MLS and server-side enforcement, the server theoretically has an ability to
add a malicious device to the MLS group and receive decryptable messages. Authenticity of devices needs
to be established to ensure a user's devices are actually a user's devices.

**TODO**: Should we bring Matrix's cross-signing here?

Servers retain the ability to control/puppet their own users due to no strong cryptographic link between
the sending device and the event which gets emitted.

# MIMI Protocol Comparison

{{!I-D.barnes-mimi-arch}}, {{!I-D.ralston-mimi-protocol}}, and {{!I-D.robert-mimi-delivery-service}}
collectively define a protocol with similar capabilities to Linearized Matrix, leaning more heavily
into the MLS layering to accomplish interoperable messaging. Linearized Matrix in contrast provides
a signaling layer for which encryption can operate, using existing open standards as the foundational
piece.

# IANA Considerations

The `m.*` namespace likely needs formal registration in some capacity.

The `I.*` namespace likely needs formal registration in some capacity.

Port 8448 may need formal registration.

The SRV service name `matrix` may need re-registering, or a new service name assigned.

The `.well-known/matrix` namespace is already registered for use by The Matrix.org Foundation C.I.C.
